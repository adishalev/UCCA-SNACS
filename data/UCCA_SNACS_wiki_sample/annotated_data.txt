In 2001 , after wrapping up the second season of The West Wing , Sorkin had a drug relapse , only two months after receiving a Phoenix Rising Award for drug recovery ; this became public knowledge when he was arrested at Burbank Airport for possession of hallucinogenic mushrooms , marijuana , and crack cocaine . He was ordered by a judge to attend a drug diversion program . His drug addiction was highly publicized , most notably when Saturday Night Live did a parody called " The West Wing " , though he did recover . In 2002 , Sorkin criticized NBC news anchor Tom Brokaw 's TV special about a day in the life of a president , " The Bush White House : Inside the Real West Wing " , comparing it to the act of sending a valentine to President George W . Bush instead of real news reporting . Sorkin 's TV series The West Wing aired on the same network , and so at the request of NBC 's Entertainment President Jeff Zucker he apologized , but would later say " there should be a difference between what NBC News does and what The West Wing TV series does .

By the 1980s Hepburn had developed a noticeable tremor , giving her a permanently shaking head . She did not work for two years , saying in a television interview , " I 've had my day â let the kids scramble and sweat it out . " During this period she saw the Broadway production of On Golden Pond , and was impressed by its depiction of an elderly married couple coping with the difficulties of old age . Jane Fonda had purchased the screen rights for her father , actor Henry Fonda , and Hepburn sought to play opposite him in the role of quirky Ethel Thayer . On Golden Pond was a success , the second - highest grossing film of 1981 . It demonstrated how energetic the 74 - year - old Hepburn was , as she dived fully clothed into Squam Lake and gave a lively singing performance . The movie won her a second BAFTA and a record fourth Academy Award . Homer Dickens , in his book on Hepburn , notes that it was widely considered a sentimental win , " a tribute to her enduring career . " Hepburn also returned to the stage in 1981 . She received a second Tony nomination for her portrayal in The West Side Waltz of a septuagenarian widow with a zest for life . Variety observed that the role was " an obvious and entirely acceptable version of [ Hepburn 's ] own public image . " Walter Kerr of The New York Times wrote of Hepburn and her performance , " One mysterious thing she has learned to do is breathe unchallengeable life into lifeless lines . " She hoped to make a film out of the production , but nobody purchased the rights . Hepburn 's reputation as one of America 's best loved actors was firmly established by this point , as she was named favorite movie actress in a survey by People magazine and again won the popularity award from People 's Choice .

In September 1980 , Lennon commented about his family and his rebellious nature : Part of me would like to be accepted by all facets of society and not be this loudmouthed lunatic poet / musician . But I cannot be what I am not ... I was the one who all the other boys ' parents — including Paul 's father — would say , ' Keep away from him ' ... The parents instinctively recognised I was a troublemaker , meaning I did not conform and I would influence their children , which I did . I did my best to disrupt every friend 's home ... Partly out of envy that I did n't have this so - called home ... but I did ... There were five women that were my family . Five strong , intelligent , beautiful women , five sisters . One happened to be my mother . [ She ] just could n't deal with life . She was the youngest and she had a husband who ran away to sea and the war was on and she could n't cope with me , and I ended up living with her elder sister . Now those women were fantastic ... And that was my first feminist education ... I would infiltrate the other boys minds . I could say , " Parents are not gods because I do n't live with mine and , therefore , I know . ' He regularly visited his cousin , Stanley Parkes , who lived in Fleetwood . Seven years Lennon 's senior , Parkes took him on trips and to local cinemas . During the school holidays , Parkes often visited Lennon with Leila Harvey , another cousin , often travelling to Blackpool two or three times a week to watch shows . They would visit the Blackpool Tower Circus and see artists such as Dickie Valentine , Arthur Askey , Max Bygraves and Joe Loss , with Parkes recalling that Lennon particularly liked George Formby . After Parkes 's family moved to Scotland , the three cousins often spent their school holidays together there . Parkes recalled , " John , cousin Leila and I were very close . From Edinburgh we would drive up to the family croft at Durness , which was from about the time John was nine years old until he was about 16 . " He was 14 years old when his uncle George died of a liver haemorrhage on 5 June 1955 ( aged 52 ) .

Depp has collaborated with director and close friend Tim Burton in films , beginning with Edward Scissorhands ( 1990 ) , opposite Winona Ryder and Vincent Price . His next role with Burton was in the 1994 film , Ed Wood . Depp later said that " within 10 minutes of hearing about the project , I was committed . " At the time , the actor was depressed about films and filmmaking . This part gave him a " chance to stretch out and have some fun " ; he said working with Landau " rejuvenated my love for acting " . Producer Scott Rudin once said , " Basically Johnny Depp is playing Tim Burton in all his movies , " although Burton personally disapproved of the comment . Depp , however agrees with Rudin 's statement . According to Depp , Edward Scissorhands represented Burton 's inability to communicate as a teenager . Ed Wood reflected Burton 's relationship with Vincent Price ( very similar with Edward D . Wood , Jr . and Béla Lugosi ) . Depp 's next venture with Burton was the role of Ichabod Crane in Sleepy Hollow ( 1999 ) , opposite Christina Ricci . Sleepy Hollow reflected Burton 's battle with the Hollywood studio system . For his performance , Depp took inspiration from Angela Lansbury , Roddy McDowall and Basil Rathbone . Depp stated , " I always thought of Ichabod as a very delicate , fragile person who was maybe a little too in touch with his feminine side , like a frightened little girl . " Depp did not work with Burton again until 2005 in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory , in which he played Willy Wonka . Depp modeled the character 's hair on Anna Wintour . The film was a box office success and received positive critical reception . Gene Wilder , who played Willy Wonka in the 1971 film , initially criticized this version . Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was released in July , followed by Corpse Bride , for which Depp voiced the character Victor Van Dort , in September . Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber of Fleet Street ( 2007 ) followed , bringing Depp his second major award win , the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy as well as his third nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor . Burton first gave him an original cast recording of the 1979 stage musical in 2000 . Although not a fan of the musical genre , Depp grew to like the tale 's treatment . He cited Peter Lorre in Mad Love ( 1935 ) as his main influence for the role , and practiced the songs his character would perform while filming Pirates of the Caribbean : At World 's End . Although he had performed in musical groups , Depp was initially unsure that he would be able to sustain Stephen Sondheim 's lyrics . Depp recorded demos and worked with Bruce Witkin to shape his vocals without a qualified voice coach . In the DVD Reviews section , Entertainment Weekly 's Chris Nashawaty gave the film an A minus , stating , " Depp 's soaring voice makes you wonder what other tricks he 's been hiding ... Watching Depp 's barber wield his razors ... it 's hard not to be reminded of Edward Scissorhands frantically shaping hedges into animal topiaries 18 years ago ... and all of the twisted beauty we would 've missed out on had [ Burton and Depp ] never met . " In his introduction to Burton on Burton , a book of interviews with the director , Depp called Burton " ... a brother , a friend , ... and [ a ] brave soul " . The next Depp - Burton collaboration was Alice in Wonderland ( 2010 ) . Depp played the Mad Hatter alongside Helena Bonham Carter , Anne Hathaway and Alan Rickman . In 2012 , he starred in the Burton - directed Dark Shadows , a film based on the 1966 – 1971 gothic soap opera of the same name , alongside fellow Tim Burton regular Helena Bonham Carter , as well as Michelle Pfeiffer and Eva Green .

In director Barry Levinson 's Rain Man ( 1988 ) , Hoffman starred as an autistic savant , opposite Tom Cruise . Levinson , Hoffman and Cruise worked for two years on the film , and Hoffman 's performance gained him his second Academy Award . Upon accepting , Hoffman stated softly to his fellow nominees that it was okay if they did n't vote for him because " I did n't vote for you guys either . " After Rain Man , Hoffman appeared with Sean Connery and Matthew Broderick in Family Business . The film did relatively poorly with the critics and at the box office . In 1991 , Hoffman voiced substitute teacher Mr . Bergstrom in The Simpsons episode " Lisa 's Substitute " , under the pseudonym Sam Etic . As a reference to this episode , during the episode featuring the Itchy & Scratchy movie , Lisa claims that Dustin Hoffman had a cameo in that movie but did n't use his real name . Throughout the 1990s , Hoffman appeared in many large , studio films , such as Dick Tracy ( 1990 ) ( where his Ishtar co-star Beatty plays the titular character ) , Hero ( 1992 ) and Billy Bathgate ( 1991 ) co-starring with Nicole Kidman who was nominated for a Golden Globe ) . Hoffman also played the title role of Captain Hook in Steven Spielberg 's Hook ( also 1991 ) , earning a Golden Globe nomination ; in this movie , Hoffman 's costume was so heavy that he had to wear an air-conditioned suit under it . Hoffman played the lead role in Outbreak ( 1995 ) , alongside Rene Russo , Kevin Spacey , Morgan Freeman , Cuba Gooding Jr . and Donald Sutherland . Following that , he appeared in the 1996 revenge - drama / legal - thriller Sleepers ( 1996 ) with Brad Pitt , Jason Patric , and Kevin Bacon . In the mid - 1990s , Hoffman starred in — and was deeply involved in the production of — David Mamet 's American Buffalo ( also 1996 ) , and an early effort of film editor Kate Sanford . In 1997 , Hoffman starred opposite John Travolta in the Costa Gavras film Mad City and gained his seventh Academy Award nomination for his performance in Wag The Dog , in a role that allowed Hoffman the chance to work with both Robert De Niro and Denis Leary . He next appeared in Barry Levinson 's adaptation of Sphere ( 1998 ) , opposite Sharon Stone , Samuel L . Jackson , Peter Coyote , Queen Latifah and Liev Schreiber . Hoffman next appeared in Moonlight Mile ( 2002 ) , followed by Confidence ( 2003 ) opposite Edward Burns , Andy García and Rachel Weisz . Hoffman finally had a chance to work with Gene Hackman in Gary Fleder 's Runaway Jury ( also 2003 ) , an adaptation of John Grisham 's bestselling novel .

Referring to his participation in the torch relay for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing , Chan spoke out against demonstrators who disrupted the relay several times attempting to draw attention to a wide - ranging number of grievances against the Chinese government , including China 's human rights record and the political status of Taiwan . He warned that he would lash out against anyone planning to stop him from carrying the Olympic Torch , saying , " Demonstrators better not get anywhere near me . " In addition , Chan felt that the protesters were publicity seekers . " They are doing it for no reason . They just want to show off on the TV , " he said . " They know , ' if I can get the torch , I can go on the TV for the world news ' . " Chan felt the country was trying to improve and the Olympics is a chance for the country to open up and learn from the outside world and vice versa . " We are not right about everything . Things are getting better in China but we can change and are changing . We want to learn from the rest of the world as well as teach others about our ways and our culture . " On 18 April 2009 , during a panel discussion at the annual Boao Forum for Asia titled " Tapping into Asia 's Creative Industry Potential , " Chan said " ... in the 10 years after Hong Kong 's return to Chinese rule , I can gradually see , I 'm not sure if it 's good to have freedom or not . " Chan went on to say , " If you 're too free , you 're like the way Hong Kong is now . It 's very chaotic . Taiwan is also chaotic . " He also added , " I 'm gradually beginning to feel that we Chinese need to be controlled . If we 're not being controlled , we 'll just do what we want . " Chan however complained about the quality of Chinese goods , saying , " ... a Chinese TV might explode . " but refrained from criticising the Chinese government for banning his 2009 film Shinjuku Incident . Chan 's comments prompted an angry response from some legislators and other prominent figures in Taiwan and Hong Kong . Hong Kong Legislator Leung Kwok - hung said that Chan " insulted the Chinese people . Chinese people are n't pets . " The Hong Kong Tourism Board stated that it had received 164 comments and complaints from the public over Chan 's remarks . A spokesman for Chan told reporters that the actor was referring to freedom in the entertainment industry rather than Chinese society at large and that certain people with " ulterior motives deliberately misinterpreted what he said . "

Elvis Aaron Presleya ( January 8 , 1935 – August 16 , 1977 ) was an American singer and actor . A cultural icon , he is commonly known by the single name Elvis . One of the most popular musicians of the 20th century , he is often referred to as the " King of Rock and Roll " or " the King " . Born in Tupelo , Mississippi , Presley moved to Memphis , Tennessee , with his family at the age of 13 . He began his career there in 1954 , working with Sun Records owner Sam Phillips , who wanted to bring the sound of African - American music to a wider audience . Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black , Presley was the most important popularizer of rockabilly , an uptempo , backbeat - driven fusion of country and rhythm and blues . RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker , who went on to manage the singer for over two decades . Presley 's first RCA single , " Heartbreak Hotel " , released in January 1956 , was a number - one hit . He became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll with a series of network television appearances and chart - topping records . His energized interpretations of songs , many from African - American sources , and his uninhibited performance style made him enormously popular — and controversial . In November 1956 , he made his film debut in Love Me Tender . Drafted into military service in 1958 , Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work . He staged few concerts however , and guided by Parker , proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood movies and soundtrack albums , most of them critically derided . In 1968 , after seven years away from the stage , he returned to live performance in a celebrated comeback television special that led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of profitable tours . In 1973 Presley staged the first concert broadcast globally via satellite , Aloha from Hawaii . Prescription drug abuse severely deteriorated his health , and he died suddenly in 1977 at the age of 42 .

In the 1960s , Warner kept pace with rapid changes in the industry and played a key role in developing films that were commercial and critical successes . In February 1962 , he purchased the film rights for the Broadway musical , My Fair Lady , paying an unprecedented $ 6.5 million . The previous owner , CBS director William S . Paley , set terms that included 50 percent of the distributor 's gross profits " plus ownership of the negative at the end of the contract . " Despite the " outrageous " purchase price , and the ungenerous terms of the contract , the deal proved lucrative for Warner Bros . , securing the studio $ 12 million in profits . Warner was criticized for choosing a non - singing star , Audrey Hepburn , to play the leading role of Eliza Doolittle ; indeed , the 1964 Academy Award for Best Actress went to Julie Andrews , who had played Eliza on Broadway and the London Stage , for Mary Poppins , while Audrey Hepburn was not even nominated . However , the film won the best - picture Academy Award for 1964 . In 1965 , Warner surprised many industry observers when he purchased the rights to Who 's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? , Edward Albee 's searing play about a destructive marriage . From the beginning , the project was beset by controversy . Ernest Lehman 's script , which was extremely faithful to Albee 's play , stretched the U.S . film industry 's Production Code to the limit . Jack Valenti , who just assumed leadership of the Motion Picture Association of America , recalled that a meeting with Warner and studio aide Ben Kalmenson left him " uneasy " . " I was uncomfortable with the thought that this was just the beginning of an unsettling new era in film , in which we would lurch from crisis to crisis without any suitable solution in sight , " Valenti wrote . Meanwhile , Lehman and the film 's director , Mike Nichols , battled with studio executives and exhibitors who insisted that the film be shot in color rather than black and white . These controversies soon faded into the background while Jack Warner challenged the validity of the production code by publicly requiring theaters showing the film to post an " Adults only " label and restrict tickets sales accordingly . At this , the MPAA , wary of a repeat of the embarrassment it had trying to censor the highly acclaimed film , The Pawnbroker , gave in and approved the film as a special exception because of its quality , which led to other filmmakers to challenge the code themselves even more aggressively . Upon its release , Who 's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? was embraced by audiences and critics alike . It secured 13 nominations from the Academy including one for Best Picture of 1966 .

In 1960 , she and Olivier divorced and Olivier married actress Joan Plowright . In his autobiography , Olivier discussed the years of problems they had experienced because of Leigh 's illness : " Throughout her possession by that uncannily evil monster , manic depression , with its deadly ever - tightening spirals , she retained her own individual canniness – an ability to disguise her true mental condition from almost all except me , for whom she could hardly be expected to take the trouble . " Merivale proved to be a stabilising influence for Leigh , but despite her apparent contentment , she was quoted by Radie Harris as confiding that she " would rather have lived a short life with Larry [ Olivier ] than face a long one without him " . Her first husband , Leigh Holman , also spent considerable time with her . Merivale joined her for a tour of Australia , New Zealand and Latin America that lasted from July 1961 until May 1962 , and Leigh enjoyed positive reviews without sharing the spotlight with Olivier . Though she was still beset by bouts of depression , she continued to work in the theatre and , in 1963 , won a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical for her role in Tovarich . She also appeared in the films The Roman Spring of Mrs . Stone ( 1961 ) and Ship of Fools ( 1965 ) . In May 1967 , she was rehearsing to appear with Michael Redgrave in Edward Albee 's A Delicate Balance when she suffered a recurrence of tuberculosis . Following several weeks of rest , she seemed to recover . On the night of 7 July 1967 , Merivale left her as usual , to perform in a play , and returned home around midnight to find her asleep . About thirty minutes later , he returned to the bedroom and discovered her body on the floor . She had been attempting to walk to the bathroom and , as her lungs filled with liquid , collapsed . Merivale contacted Olivier , who was receiving treatment for prostate cancer in a nearby hospital . In his autobiography , Olivier described his " grievous anguish " as he immediately travelled to Leigh 's residence , to find that Merivale had moved her body onto the bed . Olivier paid his respects , and " stood and prayed for forgiveness for all the evils that had sprung up between us " , before helping Merivale make funeral arrangements .

Leigh 's death certificate gave her date of death as 8 July , but some references give the date as 7 July . She was cremated at the Golders Green Crematorium and her ashes were scattered on the lake at her home , Tickerage Mill , near Blackboys , East Sussex , England . A memorial service was held at St Martin - in - the - Fields , with a final tribute read by John Gielgud . In the United States , she became the first actress honoured by " The Friends of the Libraries at the University of Southern California " . The ceremony was conducted as a memorial service , with selections from her films shown and tributes provided by such associates as George Cukor . Leigh was considered one of the most beautiful actresses of her day , and her directors emphasised this in most of her films . When asked if she believed her beauty had been an impediment to being taken seriously as an actress , she said , " People think that if you look fairly reasonable , you ca n't possibly act , and as I only care about acting , I think beauty can be a great handicap , if you really want to look like the part you 're playing , which is n't necessarily like you . " Director George Cukor commented that Leigh was a " consummate actress , hampered by beauty " , and Laurence Olivier said that critics should " give her credit for being an actress and not go on forever letting their judgments be distorted by her great beauty . " Garson Kanin shared their viewpoint and described Leigh as " a stunner whose ravishing beauty often tended to obscure her staggering achievements as an actress . Great beauties are infrequently great actresses — simply because they do n't need to be . Vivien was different ; ambitious , persevering , serious , often inspired . " Leigh explained that she played " as many different parts as possible " in an attempt to learn her craft and to dispel prejudice about her abilities . She believed that comedy was more difficult to play than drama because it required more precise timing and said that more emphasis should be placed upon comedy as part of an actor 's training . Nearing the end of her career , which ranged from Noël Coward comedies to Shakespearean tragedies , she observed , " It 's much easier to make people cry than to make them laugh . "

Jack Warner responded grudgingly to the rising popularity of television in the late 1940s . Initially , he tried to compete with the new medium , introducing gimmicks such as 3 - D films , which soon lost their appeal among moviegoers . In 1954 , Warner finally engaged the new medium , providing ABC with a weekly show , Warner Bros . Presents . The studio followed up with a series of Western dramas , such as Maverick , Bronco , and Colt .45 . Within a few years , Warner , accustomed to dealing with actors in a high - handed manner , provoked hostility among emerging TV stars like James Garner , who filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros . over a contract dispute . He was angered by the perceived ingratitude of television actors , who evidently showed more independence than film actors , and this deepened his contempt for the new medium . Following his deal with ABC , Warner also made his son , Jack Jr . , head of the company 's new television department . During this period , Warner showed little foresight in his treatment of the studio 's cartoon operation . Animated characters such as Bugs Bunny , Daffy Duck , and Porky Pig , while embraced by cartoon lovers , " were always stepchildren at Warner Bros . " As biographer Bob Thomas wrote , " Jack Warner ... considered cartoons no more than an extraneous service provided to exhibitors who wanted a full program for their customers . " In 1953 , during a rare meeting between the Warners and the studio 's cartoon makers , Jack confessed that he did n't " even know where the hell the cartoon studio is " , and Harry added , " The only thing I know is that we make Mickey Mouse , " a reference to the flagship character of a competing company , Walt Disney Productions . Several years later , Jack sold all of the 400 cartoons Warner Bros . made before 1948 for $ 3,000 apiece . As Thomas noted , " They have since earned millions , but not for Warner Bros . " Jack Warner 's tumultuous relationship with his brother , Harry , worsened in February 1956 , when Harry learned of Jack 's decision to sell the Warner Bros . ' pre - 1950 sound films to Associated Artists Productions ( soon to merge with United Artists Television ) for the modest sum of $ 21 million . ( The deal did not include the black - and - white Looney Tunes films , the first Merrie Melodie film , Lady , Play Your Mandolin ! , and the color cartoons released between August 1 , 1948 , and the close of 1949 . The black - and - white cartoons and the silent films were sold to Guild Films under license of Sunset Productions , which was established by Warners as its television subsidiary in the same manner as Columbia Pictures ' Screen Gems , and the aforementioned 1948 – 1949 color cartoons remained with Warner Brothers ) . " This is our heritage , what we worked all our lives to create , and now it is gone , " Harry exclaimed , upon hearing of the deal . The breach between Jack and Harry widened later that year . In July 1956 , Jack , Harry , and Albert announced they were putting Warner Bros . on the market . Jack , however , secretly organized a syndicate that purchased control of the company . By the time Harry and Albert learned of their brother 's dealings , it was too late . Jack , as the company 's largest stockholder , appointed himself as the new company president . Shortly after the deal was closed , Jack Warner announced that the company and its subsidiaries would be " directed more vigorously to the acquisition of the most important story properties , talents , and to the production of the finest motion pictures possible " . The two brothers had often argued , and earlier in the decade , studio employees claimed they saw Harry chase Jack through the studio with a lead pipe , shouting , " I 'll get you for this , you son of a bitch " and threatening to kill him . This subterfuge , however , proved too much for Harry ; he never spoke to Jack again . When Harry Warner died on July 27 , 1958 , Jack avoided the funeral and departed for his annual vacation at Cap d ' Antibes . Asked to respond to his brother 's death , Jack said , " I did n't give a shit about Harry . " At the same time , Jack took pride in the fact that U.S . President Dwight D . Eisenhower sent him a letter of condolence .

Chan is a spokesperson for the Government of Hong Kong , appearing in public service announcements . In a Clean Hong Kong commercial , he urged the people of Hong Kong to be more considerate with regards to littering , a problem that has been widespread for decades . Furthermore , in an advertisement promoting nationalism , he gave a short explanation of the March of the Volunteers , the national anthem of the People 's Republic of China . When Hong Kong Disneyland opened in 2005 , Chan participated in the opening ceremony . In the United States , Chan appeared alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger in a government advert to combat copyright infringement and made another public service announcement with Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca to encourage people , especially Asians , to join the Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Department . Construction has begun on a Jackie Chan museum in Shanghai . Work began in July 2008 , and although it was scheduled to be completed on October 2009 , construction continues as of January 2010 . During a news conference in Shanghai on 28 March 2004 , Chan referred to the recently concluded Republic of China presidential election , 2004 in Taiwan , in which Democratic Progressive Party candidates Chen Shui - bian and Annette Lu were re - elected as President and Vice - President as " the biggest joke in the world . " Chan 's comments were criticised by Parris Chang , a Taiwanese legislator and senior member of the DPP , who called for the government of Taiwan to take punitive steps against Chan for his comments , such as banning his movies and barring him the right to visit Taiwan . Some 50 police and security personnel were required to separate protesters from Chan , as they were attempting to spit at him when he arrived at Taipei airport for a charity sponsored by cable TV channel TVBS on 18 June 2008 . Chan insisted that his remarks were not intended to insult the people of Taiwan .

By the end of 1973 , those closest to Warner became aware of signs that he was becoming disoriented . Shortly after losing his way in the building that housed his own office , Warner retired . In 1974 , the former studio chief suffered a stroke that left him blind and enfeebled . During the next several years , he gradually lost the ability to speak and became unresponsive to friends and relatives . Finally , on August 13 , 1978 , Warner was admitted to Cedars - Sinai Hospital , where he died of a heart inflammation ( edema ) on September 9 . He was 86 years old . A funeral service was held at the Wilshire Boulevard Temple , the synagogue to which many members of the Warner family belonged . He was interred at Home of Peace Cemetery in East Los Angeles , California . Jack Warner left behind an estate estimated at $ 15 million . Much of the Warner estate , including property and memorabilia , was bequeathed to his widow , Ann . Warner , however , left $ 200,000 to his estranged son , Jack Jr . , perhaps in an effort to discourage him from contesting the will . In the days following Warner 's death , newspaper obituaries recounted the familiar story of " the four brothers who left the family butcher shop for nicklelodeons " and went on to revolutionize American cinema . A front - page story in Warner 's adopted hometown of Youngstown featured accounts of the family 's pre - Hollywood struggles in Ohio , describing how Jack Warner drove a wagon for his father 's business when he was only seven years old . The late movie [ mogul ] was widely eulogized for his role in " shaping Hollywood 's ' Golden Age ' " . Several months after Warner 's death , a more personal tribute was organized by the Friends of the Libraries at the University of Southern California . The event , called " The Colonel : An Affectionate Remembrance of Jack L . Warner " , drew Hollywood notables such as entertainers Olivia de Havilland and Debbie Reynolds , and cartoon voice actor Mel Blanc . Blanc closed the event with a rendition of Porky Pig 's famous farewell , " A - bee - a - bee - a - bee – that 's all , folks . " In recognition of his contributions to the motion picture industry , Jack Warner was accorded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame , located at 6541 Hollywood Boulevard . He is also represented on Canada 's Walk of Fame in Toronto , which honours outstanding Canadians from all fields .

Hoffman continued to appear in major films over the next few years . Who Is Harry Kellerman and Why Is He Saying Those Terrible Things About Me ? ( 1971 ) , Straw Dogs ( also 1971 ) , and Papillon ( 1973 ) were followed by Lenny ( 1974 ) , for which Hoffman received his third nomination for Best Actor in seven years . Less than two years after the Watergate scandal , Hoffman and Robert Redford starred as Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward , respectively , in All the President 's Men ( 1976 ) . Hoffman next starred in Marathon Man ( also 1976 ) , a film based on William Goldman 's novel of the same name , opposite Laurence Olivier and Roy Scheider . Hoffman 's next roles were less successful . He opted out of directing Straight Time ( 1978 ) , but starred as a thief . His next film , Michael Apted 's Agatha , was with Vanessa Redgrave as Agatha Christie . Hoffman next starred in Robert Benton 's Kramer vs . Kramer ( 1979 ) as workaholic Ted Kramer whose wife ( Meryl Streep ) unexpectedly leaves him ; he raises their son alone . Hoffman gained his first Academy Award , and the film also received the Best Picture honor , plus the awards for Best Supporting Actress ( Streep ) and Director . In Tootsie ( 1982 ) , Hoffman portrays Michael Dorsey , a struggling actor who finds himself dressing up as a woman to land a role on a soap opera . His co-star was Jessica Lange . Tootsie earned ten Academy Award nominations , including Hoffman 's fifth nomination . In 1984 , Hoffman starred as Willy Loman in the Broadway revival of the 1949 Arthur Miller play , Death of a Salesman , a role he reprised in a TV movie of the same name , for which he won the 1985 Emmy Award in the category of Outstanding Lead Actor in a TV Movie or Miniseries . He also went on to win a Golden Globe for the same performance . Hoffman 's largest film failure was Elaine May 's Ishtar , with Warren Beatty . The film faced severe production problems , received almost completely negative reviews from critics and was nominated for three Razzie awards . However , Hoffman and Beatty liked the film 's final cut and tried to defend it . Hoffman and Beatty were unaffected by the flop , and Ishtar became a cult film . James House , who later became a country music artist , served as Hoffman 's vocal coach in the film .

John Christopher " Johnny " Depp II ( born June 9 , 1963 ) is an American actor , film producer , and musician . He has won the Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild award for Best Actor . Depp rose to prominence on the 1980s television series 21 Jump Street , becoming a teen idol . Dissatisfied with that status , Depp turned to film for more challenging roles ; he played the title character of the acclaimed Edward Scissorhands ( 1990 ) and later found box office success in films such as Sleepy Hollow ( 1999 ) , Charlie and the Chocolate Factory ( 2005 ) , Alice in Wonderland ( 2010 ) , Rango ( 2011 ) and the Pirates of the Caribbean film series ( 2003 – present ) . He has collaborated with director and friend Tim Burton in eight films ; the most recent being Dark Shadows ( 2012 ) . Depp has gained acclaim for his portrayals of such people as Ed Wood in Ed Wood , Joseph D . Pistone in Donnie Brasco , Hunter S . Thompson in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas , George Jung in Blow , and the bank robber John Dillinger in Michael Mann 's Public Enemies . Films featuring Depp have grossed over $ 3 . 1billion at the United States box office and over $ 7.6 billion worldwide . He has been nominated for top awards many times , winning the Best Actor Awards from the Golden Globes for Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber of Fleet Street and from the Screen Actors Guild for Pirates of the Caribbean : The Curse of the Black Pearl . He also has garnered a sex symbol status in American cinema , being twice named as the " Sexiest Man Alive " by People magazine in 2003 and 2009 . He has been listed in the 2012 Guinness Book of World Records as the highest paid actor , with $ 75million . Depp was born in Owensboro , Kentucky , and raised in Florida , as the youngest of four children of Betty Sue Palmer ( née Wells ) , a waitress , and John Christopher Depp , a civil engineer . The two divorced when Johnny was 15 . The BBC genealogical TV program Who Do You Think You Are ? , traced Depp 's family name , Deppes , to 14th - century French Huguenots living in England . In a 2002 interview , Depp stated that he believed he has Native American ancestry ; in 2011 , he specified , " I guess I have some Native American [ in me ] somewhere down the line . My great - grandmother was quite a bit of Native American , she grew up Cherokee or maybe Creek Indian . Makes sense in terms of coming from Kentucky , which is rife with Cherokee and Creek . " The family moved frequently during Depp 's childhood , and he and his siblings lived in more than 20 different locations , settling in Miramar , Florida , in 1970 . In 1978 , Depp 's parents divorced . His mother married , as her second husband , Robert Palmer ( died 2000 ) , whom Depp called " an inspiration to me " . Depp engaged in self - harm when he was young , due to the stress of dealing with family problems , which resulted in several self - inflicted scars . In a 1993 interview , he reflected on his self - injury by saying " My body is a journal in a way . It 's like what sailors used to do , where every tattoo meant something , a specific time in your life when you make a mark on yourself , whether you do it yourself with a knife or with a professional tattoo artist " .

Lennon was born in war - time England , on 9 October 1940 at Liverpool Maternity Hospital to Julia ( née Stanley ) and Alfred Lennon , a merchant seaman who was away at the time of his son 's birth . His parents named him John Winston Lennon after his paternal grandfather , John " Jack " Lennon , and then - Prime Minister Winston Churchill . His father was often away from home but sent regular pay cheques to 9 Newcastle Road , Liverpool , where Lennon lived with his mother , but the cheques stopped when he went absent without leave in February 1944 . When he eventually came home six months later , he offered to look after the family , but Julia — by then pregnant with another man 's child — rejected the idea . After her sister , Mimi Smith , twice complained to Liverpool 's Social Services , Julia handed the care of Lennon over to her . In July 1946 Lennon 's father visited Smith and took his son to Blackpool , secretly intending to emigrate to New Zealand with him . Julia followed them — with her partner at the time , ' Bobby ' Dykins — and after a heated argument his father forced the five - year - old to choose between them . Lennon twice chose his father , but as his mother walked away , he began to cry and followed her . It would be 20 years before he had contact with his father again . Throughout the rest of his childhood and adolescence he lived with his aunt and uncle , Mimi and George Smith , who had no children of their own , at Mendips , 251 Menlove Avenue , Woolton . His aunt purchased volumes of short stories for him , and his uncle , a dairyman at his family 's farm , bought him a mouth organ and engaged him in solving crossword puzzles . Julia visited Mendips on a regular basis , and when he was 11 years old he often visited her at 1 Blomfield Road , Liverpool , where she played him Elvis Presley records , and taught him the banjo , learning how to play " Ai n't That a Shame " by Fats Domino .

Hepburn made her only appearance at the Academy Awards in 1974 , to present the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award to Lawrence Weingarten . She received a standing ovation , and joked with the audience , " I 'm very happy I did n't hear anyone call out ' It 's about time ' . " The following year , she was paired with John Wayne in the Western Rooster Cogburn , a sequel to his Oscar-winning film True Grit . Echoing her African Queen character Rose Sayer , Hepburn again played a deeply religious spinster who teams up with a masculine loner to avenge a family member 's death . The movie received mediocre reviews . Its casting was enough to draw some people to the box office , but it did not meet studio expectations and was only moderately successful . In 1976 , Hepburn returned to Broadway for a three-month run of A Matter of Gravity . The role of eccentric Mrs. Basil was deemed a perfect showcase for the actress , and the play was popular despite poor reviews . It later went on a successful nationwide tour . During its Los Angeles run , Hepburn fractured her hip . She chose to continue the tour performing in a wheelchair . That year , she was voted " Favorite Motion Picture Actress " by the People 's Choice Awards . After three years away from the screen , Hepburn starred in the 1978 film Olly Olly Oxen Free . The adventure comedy was one of the biggest failures of her career â the screenwriter James Prideaux , who worked with Hepburn , later wrote that it " died at the moment of release " and referred to it as her " lost film " . Hepburn claimed the main reason she had done the film was the opportunity to ride in a hot air balloon . The television movie The Corn Is Green ( 1979 ) , which was filmed in Wales , followed . It was the last of ten films Hepburn made with George Cukor , and gained her a third Emmy nomination .

McCartney 's music has appeared on several record labels . In January 1962 , Polydor Records issued the first commercially released recording of the Beatles , a single called " My Bonnie " . Credited to Tony Sheridan and the Beat Brothers , Decca Records issued the track in the UK in April 1962 . The following year , Parlophone released the band 's singles " Please Please Me " / " Ask Me Why " and " From Me to You " / " Thank You Girl " in the UK . Vee-Jay Records released them in the US . Also that year , Swan Records released the group 's UK Parlophone single " She Loves You " / " I 'll Get You " in the US . From then until July 1968 , EMI 's Capitol ( US ) and Parlophone ( UK ) labels released the band 's music . Starting with the August 1968 release " Hey Jude " / " Revolution " , their new material would be issued with Apple labels , logos and sleeves , but with Parlophone or Capitol serial numbers . Following the break - up of the Beatles , McCartney 's music continued to be released by Apple Records under the Beatles ' 1967 recording contract with EMI which ran until 1976 . Following the formal dissolution of the Beatles ' partnership in 1975 , McCartney re-signed with EMI worldwide and Capitol in the US and Canada . In 1979 , McCartney signed with Columbia Records in the US and Canada reportedly receiving the industry 's most lucrative recording contract to date , while remaining with EMI for distribution throughout the rest of the world . McCartney returned to Capitol in 1985 and from 1985 until 2006 , Parlophone released McCartney 's music in the UK and Capitol in the US . In 2007 , McCartney signed with Hear Music , becoming the label 's first artist . He remains there as of 2012 's Kisses on the Bottom . In 1963 , Dick James established Northern Songs to publish the songs of Lennon – McCartney . McCartney initially owned 20% of Northern Songs , which became 15 % after a public stock offering in 1965 . In 1969 , James sold a controlling interest in Northern Songs to Lew Grade 's Associated Television ( ATV ) after which McCartney and John Lennon sold their remaining shares although they remained under contract to ATV until 1973 . In 1972 , McCartney re - signed with ATV for seven years in a joint publishing agreement between ATV and McCartney Music . Since 1979 , MPL Communications has published McCartney 's songs . McCartney and Yoko Ono attempted to purchase the Northern Songs catalogue in 1981 , but Grade declined their offer and decided to sell ATV in its entirety to businessman Robert Holmes à Court . Michael Jackson subsequently purchased ATV in 1985 . In 1995 , Jackson merged his catalogue with Sony for a reported £ 59 , 052 , 000 ( $ 95 million ) , establishing Sony / ATV Music Publishing , in which he retained half - ownership . McCartney has criticised Jackson 's purchase and handling of Northern Songs over the years . Now formally dissolved , in 1995 it became absorbed in the Sony / ATV catalogue . McCartney receives writers ' royalties which together are 33⅓ percent of total commercial proceeds in the US , and which vary elsewhere between 50 and 55 percent . Two of the Beatles ' earliest songs — " Love Me Do " and " P.S . I Love You " — were published by an EMI subsidiary , Ardmore & Beechwood , before signing with James . McCartney acquired their publishing rights from Ardmore in the mid - 1980s , and they are the only two Beatles songs owned by MPL Communications .

Sorkin wrote 87 screenplays in all , which amounts to nearly every episode during the show 's first four Emmy - winning seasons . Sorkin describes his role in the creative process as " not so much [ that of ] a showrunner or a producer . I 'm really a writer . " He admits that this approach can have its drawbacks , saying " Out of 88 [ West Wing ] episodes that I did we were on time and on budget never , not once . " In 2003 , at the end of the fourth season , Sorkin and fellow executive producer Thomas Schlamme left the show due to internal conflicts at Warner Bros. TV not involving the NBC network , thrusting producer John Wells into an expanded role as showrunner . Sorkin never watched any episodes beyond his writing tenture apart from 60 seconds of the first season five episode , describing the experience as " like watching somebody make out with my girlfriend . " Sorkin would later return in the final episode in a cameo appearance as a member of President Bartlet 's staff . In 2003 Sorkin divulged to the American television interviewer Charlie Rose on The Charlie Rose Show that he was developing a TV series based on a late - night sketch comedy show like Saturday Night Live . In early October 2005 a pilot script dubbed Studio 7 on the Sunset Strip for a new TV series , written by him and with Tommy Schlamme attached as producer , started circulating around Hollywood and generating interest on the web . A week later , NBC bought from Warner Bros . TV the right to show the TV series on their network for a near - record license fee in a bidding war with CBS . The show 's name was later changed to Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip . Sorkin described the show as having " autobiographical elements " to it and " characters that are based on actual people " but said that it departs from those beginnings to look at the backstage maneuverings at a late night sketch comedy show .

In 2003 , Sorkin was writing a screenplay on spec about the story of inventor and television pioneer Philo Farnsworth , a topic he had first become familiar with back in the early 1990s when producer Fred Zollo approached him with the idea of adapting a memoir by Elma Farnsworth into a biopic . The next year he completed the screenplay under the title " The Farnsworth Invention " , and it was picked up by New Line Cinema with Thomas Schlamme signed on to direct . The story is about the patent battle between inventor Philo Farnsworth and RCA tycoon David Sarnoff for the technology that allowed the first television transmissions in the US . At the same time , Sorkin was contacted by Jocelyn Clarke , the commissions manager of the Abbey Theatre in Dublin , requesting he write a play for them , a commission which he accepted . In time Sorkin decided to tackle his commission by rewriting " The Farnsworth Invention " as a play . He delivered a first draft of the play to the Abbey Theatre in early 2005 , and a production was purportedly planned for 2007 with La Jolla Playhouse in California deciding to stage a workshop production of the play in collaboration with the Abbey Theatre . But in 2006 the Abbey Theatre 's new management pulled out of all involvement with The Farnsworth Invention . Despite the setback , La Jolla Playhouse pushed on , with Steven Spielberg lending his talents as producer . The production opened under La Jolla 's signature Page To Stage program which allowed Sorkin and director Des McAnuff to develop the play from show to show according to audience reactions and feedback ; the play ran at La Jolla Playhouse from February 20 , 2007 through March 25 , 2007 . A production followed on Broadway , beginning in previews at the Music Box Theatre and scheduled to open on November 14 , 2007 ; however , the play was delayed by the 2007 Broadway stagehand strike . The Farnsworth Invention eventually opened at the Music Box Theatre on December 3 , 2007 following the end of the strike ; it closed on March 2 , 2008 . In 2005 , Sorkin revised his play A Few Good Men for a revival at the London West End theatre , the Haymarket . The play opened at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in the fall of the same year and was directed by David Esbjornson , with Rob Lowe of The West Wing in the lead role .

Davis was the co - founder of the Hollywood Canteen , and was the first female president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences . She won the Academy Award for Best Actress twice , was the first person to accrue 10 Academy Award nominations for acting , and was the first woman to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Film Institute . Her career went through several periods of eclipse , and she admitted that her success had often been at the expense of her personal relationships . Married four times , she was once widowed and thrice divorced , and raised her children as a single parent . Her final years were marred by a long period of ill health , but she continued acting until shortly before her death from breast cancer , with more than 100 films , television and theater roles to her credit . In 1999 , Davis was placed second , after Katharine Hepburn , on the American Film Institute 's list of the greatest female stars of all time . Ruth Elizabeth Davis , known from early childhood as " Betty " , was born in Lowell , Massachusetts , the daughter of Ruth Augusta " Ruthie " ( née Favor ) and Harlow Morrell Davis , a patent attorney ; her sister , Barbara " Bobby " , was born October 25 , 1909 . The family was Protestant , of English , French , and Welsh ancestry . In 1915 , Davis 's parents separated and Betty and Bobby attended a Spartan boarding school called Crestalban in Lanesborough , which is located in the Berkshires . In 1921 , Ruth Davis moved to New York City with her daughters , where she worked as a portrait photographer . Betty was inspired to become an actress after seeing Rudolph Valentino in The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse ( 1921 ) and Mary Pickford in Little Lord Fauntleroy ( 1921 ) , and changed the spelling of her name to " Bette " after Honoré de Balzac 's La Cousine Bette . She received encouragement from her mother , who had aspired to become an actress .

Lennon was raised as an Anglican and attended Dovedale Primary School . From September 1952 to 1957 , after passing his Eleven - Plus exam , he attended Quarry Bank High School in Liverpool , and was described by Harvey at the time as , " A happy - go - lucky , good - humoured , easy going , lively lad . " He often drew comical cartoons which appeared in his own self - made school magazine called The Daily Howl , but despite his artistic talent , his school reports were damning : " Certainly on the road to failure ... hopeless ... rather a clown in class ... wasting other pupils ' time . " His mother bought him his first guitar in 1956 , an inexpensive Gallotone Champion acoustic for which she " lent " her son five pounds and ten shillings on the condition that the guitar be delivered to her own house , and not Mimi ' s , knowing well that her sister was not supportive of her son 's musical aspirations . As Mimi was sceptical of his claim that he would be famous one day , she hoped he would grow bored with music , often telling him , " The guitar 's all very well , John , but you 'll never make a living out of it " . On 15 July 1958 , when Lennon was 17 years old , his mother , walking home after visiting the Smiths ' house , was struck by a car and killed . Lennon failed all his GCE O - level examinations , and was accepted into the Liverpool College of Art only after his aunt and headmaster intervened . Once at the college , he started wearing Teddy Boy clothes and acquired a reputation for disrupting classes and ridiculing teachers . As a result , he was excluded from the painting class , then the graphic arts course , and was threatened with expulsion for his behaviour , which included sitting on a nude model 's lap during a life drawing class . He failed an annual exam , despite help from fellow student and future wife Cynthia Powell , and was " thrown out of the college before his final year . "

Hepburn quickly returned to acting after Tracy 's death , choosing to preoccupy herself as a remedy against grief . She received numerous scripts and chose to play Eleanor of Aquitaine in The Lion In Winter ( 1968 ) , a part she called " fascinating " . She read extensively in preparation for the role , in which she starred opposite Peter O'Toole . Filming took place in Montmajour Abbey in the south of France , an experience she loved despite being — according to director Anthony Harvey — " enormously vulnerable " throughout . John Russell Taylor of The Times suggested that Eleanor was " the performance of her ... career " , and proved that she was " a growing , developing , still surprising actress " . The movie was nominated in all the major categories at the Academy Awards , and for the second year running Hepburn won the Oscar for Best Actress . The role , combined with her performance in Guess Who 's Coming to Dinner , also won Hepburn a British Academy Film Award ( BAFTA ) for Best Actress . Hepburn 's next appearance was in The Madwoman of Chaillot ( 1969 ) , which she filmed in Nice immediately after completing The Lion in Winter . The picture was a failure critically and financially , and reviews targeted Hepburn for giving a misguided performance . From December 1969 to August 1970 , Hepburn starred in the Broadway musical Coco , about the life of Coco Chanel . Hepburn admitted that before the show , she had never sat through a theatrical musical . She was not a strong singer , but found the offer irresistible and , as Berg puts it , " what she lacked in euphony she made up for in guts " . The actress took vocal lessons six times a week in preparation for the show . She was nervous about every performance , and recalled " wondering what the hell I was doing there . " Reviews for the production were mediocre , but Hepburn herself was praised and Coco was popular with the public . Hepburn would typically receive a standing ovation at the end of the night , and the show 's run was twice extended . She later said Coco marked the first time she accepted that the public were not against her , but actually seemed to love her . Her work earned Hepburn a Tony Award nomination for Best Actress in a Musical .

In 2012 , Gyllenhaal starred alongside Michael Peña in David Ayer 's film End of Watch about two Los Angeles street cops . The film was released on September 21 , 2012 and received positive reviews , with Roger Ebert saying that " End of Watch " is one of the best police movies in recent years , a virtuoso fusion of performances and often startling action " and Salon . com 's Andrew O ' Hehir stating that the film was " at least the best cop movie since James Gray 's " We Own the Night , " and very likely since Antoine Fuqua 's memorable " Training Day " ( which , not coincidentally , was written by Ayer ) " . To train for the role , Gyllenhaal took tactical training and participated in actual police drives with co - star Michael Peña to help establish the language of the Salon characters The son of director Stephen Gyllenhaal and screenwriter Naomi Foner , Gyllenhaal 's immediate family includes his sister , actress Maggie , who is married to actor Peter Sarsgaard , Gyllenhaal 's co - star in Jarhead and Rendition . In December 2006 , Jake and his sister escaped a fire that destroyed Manka ' s , a famed lodge and restaurant in Inverness , California , at which they were vacationing . Gyllenhaal 's niece , Ramona Sarsgaard , was born on October 3 , 2006 . Jamie Lee Curtis is Gyllenhaal 's godmother , and he has repeatedly referred to his godfathers being a gay couple . Gyllenhaal himself is the godfather of Matilda Rose Ledger ( born October 28 , 2005 ) , daughter of Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams , both of whom co - starred with him in Brokeback Mountain . Gyllenhaal dated actress Kirsten Dunst for nearly two years , starting in 2002 . He later dated his Rendition co - star Reese Witherspoon from about 2007 to 2009 . He dated singer - songwriter Taylor Swift from October 2010 until January 2011 . Gyllenhaal is politically active . He shot a commercial for Rock the Vote , and along with his sister , visited the University of Southern California to encourage students to vote during the 2004 U.S. Election . He also campaigned for Democratic Presidential candidate John Kerry . He has said , however , that " it frustrates me when actors talk politics ; I 'm political and I make choices in my movies that I think are political . I try and say things with what I do . Rightly or wrongly , young actors have all the power . " In an interview for Rendition , he remarked that " it 's a sad time when actors are politicians and politicians are actors . "

Pitt was cast as Billy Canton , a drug addict who takes advantage of a young runaway ( played by Juliette Lewis ) in the 1990 NBC television movie Too Young to Die ? , the story of an abused teenager sentenced to death for a murder . Ken Tucker , television reviewer for Entertainment Weekly wrote : " Pitt is a magnificent slimeball as her hoody boyfriend ; looking and sounding like a malevolent John Cougar Mellencamp , he 's really scary . " The same year , Pitt co-starred in six episodes of the short-lived Fox drama Glory Days , and took a supporting role in the HBO television movie The Image . His next appearance came in the 1991 film Across the Tracks ; Pitt portrayed Joe Maloney , a high school runner with a criminal brother , played by Ricky Schroder . After years of supporting roles in movies and frequent television guest appearances , Pitt attracted wider recognition in his supporting role in the 1991 road film Thelma & Louise . He played J.D . , a small-time criminal who befriends Thelma ( Geena Davis ) . His love scene with Davis has been cited as the event that defined Pitt as a sex symbol . After Thelma & Louise , Pitt starred in the 1991 film Johnny Suede , a low - budget picture about an aspiring rock star , and the 1992 film Cool World , although neither furthered his career , having poor reviews and box office performance . Pitt took the role of Paul Maclean in the 1992 biographical film A River Runs Through It , directed by Robert Redford . His portrayal of the character has been described as a career-making performance , proving that Pitt could be more than a " cowboy - hatted hunk . " He has admitted to feeling under pressure when making the film and thought it one of his " weakest performances ... It 's so weird that it ended up being the one that I got the most attention for . " Pitt believed that he benefited from working with such a talented cast and crew . He compared working with Redford to playing tennis with a superior player , saying " when you play with somebody better than you , your game gets better . "

He returned to Thompson 's work with a film adaptation of the novel The Rum Diary , released in 2011 . Critics have described Depp 's roles as characters who are " iconic loners . " Depp has noted this period of his career was full of " studio defined failures " and films that were " box office poison , " but he thought the studios never understood the films and did not do a good job of marketing . Depp has chosen roles which he found interesting , rather than those he thought would succeed at the box office .

In 1994 , Depp was arrested and questioned by police for allegedly causing serious damage to a New York City hotel suite . He was arrested again in 1999 for brawling with paparazzi outside a restaurant while dining in London with Paradis . On the 16 October 2011 episode of Larry King Live , when asked by Larry King if he had faith , Depp replied , " Yes . I have faith in my kids . And I have - I have faith , you know , that as long as you keep moving forward , just keep walking forward , things will be all right , I suppose , you know . Faith in terms of religion , I do n't - religion is not my specialty , you know . " Depp has around 13 tattoos , many of them signifying important persons or events in his life . They include a Native American in profile and a ribbon reading " Wino Forever " ( originally " Winona Forever " , altered after his breakup with Winona Ryder ) on his right biceps , " Lily - Rose " ( his daughter 's name ) over his heart , " Betty Sue " ( his mother 's name ) on his left biceps , and a sparrow flying over water with the word " Jack " ( his son 's name ; the sparrow is flying towards him rather than away from him as it is in Pirates of the Caribbean ) on his right forearm . In 2003 , Depp told Germany 's Stern magazine , " America is dumb , is something like a dumb puppy that has big teeth — that can bite and hurt you , aggressive . " Although he later asserted that the magazine misquoted him and the quotation was taken out of context , Stern stood by its story , as did CNN . com in its coverage of the interview . CNN added his remark that he would like his children " to see America as a toy , a broken toy . Investigate it a little , check it out , get this feeling and then get out . " The July 17 , 2006 edition of Newsweek reprinted the " dumb puppy " quotation , verbatim , in the context of a Letter to the Magazine . Depp has also disagreed with subsequent media reports that perceived him as a " European wannabe " , saying that he likes the anonymity of living in France and his simpler life there .

Willie Chan had become Jackie 's personal manager and firm friend , and has remained so for over 30 years . He was instrumental in launching Chan 's international career , beginning with his first forays into the American film industry in the 1980s . His first Hollywood film was Battle Creek Brawl in 1980 . Chan then played a minor role in the 1981 film The Cannonball Run , which grossed US $ 100 million worldwide . Despite being largely ignored by audiences in favour of established American actors like Burt Reynolds , Chan was impressed by the outtakes shown at the closing credits , inspiring him to include the same device in his future films . After the commercial failure of The Protector in 1985 , Chan temporarily abandoned his attempts to break into the US market , returning his focus to Hong Kong films . Back in Hong Kong , Chan 's films began to reach a larger audience in East Asia , with early successes in the lucrative Japanese market including The Young Master ( 1980 ) and Dragon Lord ( 1982 ) . The Young Master went on to beat previous box office records set by Bruce Lee and established Chan as Hong Kong cinema 's top star . With Dragon Lord , he began experimenting with elaborate stunt action sequences , including a pyramid fight scene that holds the record for the most takes for a single sequence of scenes with 2900 takes , and the final fight scene where he performs various stunts , including one where he does a back flip off a loft and falls to the lower ground . Chan produced a number of action comedy films with his opera school friends Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao . The three co - starred together for the first time in 1983 in Project A , which introduced a dangerous stunt - driven style of martial arts that won it the Best Action Design Award at the third annual Hong Kong Film Awards . Over the following two years , the " Three Brothers " appeared in Wheels on Meals and the original Lucky Stars trilogy . In 1985 , Chan made the first Police Story film , a US - influenced action comedy in which Chan performed a number of dangerous stunts . It was named the " Best Film " at the 1986 Hong Kong Film Awards . In 1987 , Chan played " Asian Hawk , " an Indiana Jones - esque character , in the film Armour of God . The film was Chan 's biggest domestic box office success up to that point , grossing over HK$35 million .

Meanwhile , Jack Warner 's role in production became somewhat limited . After acquiring a creative property , he often had little to do with a film 's production until it was ready for preview . Nevertheless , Warner could be heavyhanded in his dealings with employees , and he was " merciless in his firings . " Film director Gottfried Reinhardt claimed that Warner " derived pleasure " from humiliating subordinates . " Harry Cohn was a sonofabitch , " Reinhardt said , " but he did it for business ; he was not a sadist . [ Louis B . ] Mayer could be a monster , but he was not mean for the sake of meanness . Jack was . " Warner 's management style frustrated many studio employees . Comedian Jack Benny , who once worked at Warner Bros . , quipped , " Jack Warner would rather tell a bad joke than make a good movie " . Warner frequently clashed with actors and supposedly banned them from the studio 's executive dining room , with the explanation , " I do n't need to look at actors when I eat . " The studio executive did , however , win the affection of a few film personalities . Among these was Bette Davis , one of the studio 's leading stars , who once fled to England to secure release from her contract . In later years , Davis defended Warner against rumors of sexual impropriety when she wrote : " No lecherous boss was he ! His sins lay elsewhere . He was the father . The power . The glory . And he was in business to make money . " Davis revealed that , after the birth of her child , Warner 's attitude toward her became warm and protective . " We became father and child , no question about it . " she said . " He told me I did n't have to come back to work until I really felt like it . He was a thoughtful man . Not many nice things were said about him . " Warner also earned the gratitude and affection of Errol Flynn . In 1935 , the studio head personally selected Flynn for the title role of Captain Blood , even though Flynn was an unknown actor at the time . In 1936 , following the success of another costume epic , The Charge of the Light Brigade , Warner tore up Flynn 's contract and signed him to a long - term deal that doubled his weekly salary .

In August 1953 , Presley walked into the offices of Sun Records . He aimed to pay for a few minutes of studio time to record a two - sided acetate disc : " My Happiness " and " That 's When Your Heartaches Begin " . He would later claim he intended the record as a gift for his mother , or was merely interested in what he " sounded like " , though there was a much cheaper , amateur record - making service at a nearby general store . Biographer Peter Guralnick argues that he chose Sun in the hope of being discovered . Asked by receptionist Marion Keisker what kind of singer he was , Presley responded , " I sing all kinds . " When she pressed him on whom he sounded like , he repeatedly answered , " I do n't sound like nobody . " After he recorded , Sun boss Sam Phillips asked Keisker to note down the young man 's name , which she did along with her own commentary : " Good ballad singer . Hold . " Presley cut a second acetate in January 1954 — " I 'll Never Stand In Your Way " and " It Would n't Be the Same Without You " — but again nothing came of it . Not long after , he failed an audition for a local vocal quartet , the Songfellows . He explained to his father , " They told me I could n't sing . " Songfellow Jim Hamill later claimed that he was turned down because he did not demonstrate an ear for harmony at the time . In April , Presley began working for the Crown Electric company as a truck driver . His friend Ronnie Smith , after playing a few local gigs with him , suggested he contact Eddie Bond , leader of Smith 's professional band , which had an opening for a vocalist . Bond rejected him after a tryout , advising Presley to stick to truck driving " because you 're never going to make it as a singer . " Phillips , meanwhile , was always on the lookout for someone who could bring to a broader audience the sound of the black musicians on whom Sun focused . As Keisker reported , " Over and over I remember Sam saying , ' If I could find a white man who had the Negro sound and the Negro feel , I could make a billion dollars . ' " In June , he acquired a demo recording of a ballad , " Without You " , that he thought might suit the teenaged singer . Presley came by the studio , but was unable to do it justice . Despite this , Phillips asked Presley to sing as many numbers as he knew . He was sufficiently affected by what he heard to invite two local musicians , guitarist Winfield " Scotty " Moore and upright bass player Bill Black , to work something up with Presley for a recording session .

In recent years , the ageing Chan grew tired of being typecast as an action hero , prompting him to act with more emotion in his latest films . In New Police Story , he portrayed a character suffering from alcoholism and mourning his murdered colleagues . To further shed the image of Mr . Nice Guy , Chan played an anti - hero for the first time in Rob - B - Hood starring as Thongs , a burglar with gambling problems . In 2000 , Chan hosted a fictionalised version of himself in the animated series Jackie Chan Adventures , which ran until 2005 . In July 2008 , the BTV reality television series entitled The Disciple Jackie Chan Traditional Chinese 龍的傳人 Simplified Chinese 龙的传人 [ show ] Transcriptions ( lit . " Disciple of the Dragon " ) concluded . The series was produced by , and featured Jackie Chan . The aim of the program was to find a new star , skilled in acting and martial arts , to become Chan 's " successor " and student in filmmaking . Contestants were trained by Jackie Chan Stunt Team members Alan Wu and He Jun and competed in various fields , including explosion scenes , high - altitude wire - suspension , gunplay , car stunts , diving , obstacles courses etc . The regular judges on the program were He Ping , Wu Yue and Cheng Pei Pei . Guest judges include Stanley Tong , Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao . The " Finals " began on 5 April 2008 , with 16 contestants remaining , and concluded on 26 June 2008 . Amongst those in attendance were Tsui Hark , John Woo , Ng See Yuen and Yu Rongguang . The winner of the series was Jack Tu ( Tu Sheng Cheng ) . Along with runners up Yang Zheng and Jerry Liau , Tu is now set to star in three modern Chinese action films , one of which was scripted by Chan , and all three will be co - produced by Chan and his company JCE Movies Limited . The films will be entitled Speedpost 206 , Wo n't Tell You and Tropical Tornado and will be directed by Xie Dong , Jiang Tao and Cai Rong Hui . All 16 finalists will be given the opportunity to work on the films , or to join the Jackie Chan Stunt Team . Production on the first film is due to begin in September 2008 . In addition , the finalists will be given roles in a forthcoming BTV action series .

In 2011 , Depp became a U . S . resident again , because France wanted him to become a permanent resident , which he said would require him to pay income tax in both countries . Depp was adopted as an honorary son by LaDonna Harris , a member of the Comanche Nation , on May 22 , 2012 ; this makes him an honorary member of Harris 's family , but not an enrolled member of the Nation . Harris , president of Americans for Indian Opportunity , invited him to join her family after hearing he would be portraying the role of Tonto as a Comanche in The Lone Ranger , a feature film scheduled for 2013 release . The ceremony took place at Harris ’s home ; Comanche Nation Tribal Administrator Johnny Wauqua was in attendance . Depp was presented with gifts by the family , which he then presented to the attendees , as per tradition . Controversy arose over both the adoption and Depp 's portrayal of a Native American character , as Depp was not raised in , nor has confirmable ancestry from , a Native American community , though he has said he " guesses " he may have some distant Cherokee or Creek ancestry . Some have wondered why he has not verified his Native American ancestry with the Cherokee or any tribe when the information is easily available . His comment that if you 're Native American , " you have to think , somewhere along the line , I ’ m the product of some horrific rape " was believed by many Indians to be ignorant and insensitive . On the original Lone Ranger radio show , Tonto was identified as being from the Potawatomi tribe .

2005 was a prolific year for Gyllenhaal , who starred in the critically praised films Proof , Jarhead , and Brokeback Mountain . In Proof , featuring Gwyneth Paltrow and Anthony Hopkins , Gyllenhaal played a graduate student in mathematics who tries to convince Paltrow 's character to publish a revolutionary proof to a problem puzzling the mathematicians ' community .

He also auditioned to be Batman for one of the biggest blockbusters Batman Begins and came close to getting the role but Christian Bale was ultimately chosen for it . In Brokeback Mountain , Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger play young men who meet as sheep herders and embark upon a sexual relationship that begins in the summer of 1963 and lasts for 20 years .

The film won the Golden Lion prize at the Venice Film Festival . The film went on to win four Golden Globe Awards , four British Academy of Film and Television Arts ( BAFTA ) Awards , and three Academy Awards . Gyllenhaal was nominated for an Academy Award in the category of Best Supporting Actor for his performance , but lost to George Clooney for Syriana . Gyllenhaal also won the Best Supporting Actor BAFTA for the same role and received a Best Supporting Actor nomination and Best Film Ensemble nomination from the Screen Actors Guild . Also for Brokeback Mountain , he and Ledger won an MTV Movie Award for " Best Kiss " in 2006 . Shortly after the 2006 Academy Awards , Gyllenhaal was invited to join the Academy in recognition of his acting career .

Lennon grew concerned that fans attending Beatles ' concerts were unable to hear the music above the screaming of fans , and that the band 's musicianship was beginning to suffer as a result . Lennon 's " Help ! " expressed his own feelings in 1965 : " I meant it ... It was me singing ' help ' " . He had put on weight ( he would later refer to this as his " Fat Elvis " period ) , and felt he was subconsciously seeking change . The following January he was unknowingly introduced to LSD when a dentist , hosting a dinner party attended by Lennon , Harrison and their wives , spiked the guests ' coffee with the drug . When they wanted to leave , their host revealed what they had taken , and strongly advised them not to leave the house because of the likely effects . Later , in an elevator at a nightclub , they all believed it was on fire : " We were all screaming ... hot and hysterical . " A few months later in March , during an interview with Evening Standard reporter Maureen Cleave , Lennon remarked , " Christianity will go . It will vanish and shrink ... We 're more popular than Jesus now — I do n't know which will go first , rock and roll or Christianity . " The comment went virtually unnoticed in England but caused great offence in the US when quoted by a magazine there five months later . The furore that followed — burning of Beatles ' records , Ku Klux Klan activity and threats against Lennon — contributed to the band 's decision to stop touring . Deprived of the routine of live performances after their final commercial concert on 29 August 1966 , Lennon felt lost and considered leaving the band . Since his involuntary introduction to LSD in January , he had made increasing use of the drug , and was almost constantly under its influence for much of the year . According to biographer Ian MacDonald , Lennon 's continuous experience with LSD during the year brought him " close to erasing his identity " . 1967 saw the release of " Strawberry Fields Forever " , hailed by Time magazine for its " astonishing inventiveness " , and the group 's landmark album Sgt . Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band , which revealed Lennon 's lyrics contrasting strongly with the simple love songs of the Lennon – McCartney 's early years .

Hepburn 's only husband was Ludlow Ogden Smith , a socialite businessman from Philadelphia whom she met while a student at Bryn Mawr . The couple married on December 12 , 1928 , when she was 21 and he was 29 . Hepburn made Smith change his name to S . Ogden Ludlow so that she would not be known as " Kate Smith " , which she considered too plain . She never fully committed to the relationship and prioritized her career . The move to Hollywood in 1932 cemented the couple 's estrangement , and in 1934 , she traveled to Mexico to get a quick divorce . Hepburn often expressed her gratitude toward Smith for his financial and moral support in the early days of her career , and in her autobiography called herself " a terrible pig " for exploiting his love . The pair remained friends until his death in 1979 . Soon after moving to California , Hepburn began a relationship with her agent Leland Hayward . Both were married . Hayward proposed to Hepburn after they had each divorced , but she did not wish to be married again . She " liked the idea of being my own single self . " They were involved for four years . In 1936 , while she was touring Jane Eyre , Hepburn began a relationship with entrepreneur Howard Hughes . They first met while Hepburn was filming Sylvia Scarlett , when they were introduced by their mutual friend Cary Grant . Hughes wished to marry her , and the tabloids reported their impending nuptials , but at that time Hepburn was too focused on resurrecting her failing career . They separated in 1938 , when Hepburn left Hollywood after being labeled " box office poison " .

Paul and Linda were vegetarians for most of their 30 - year marriage . They decided to stop consuming meat after Paul saw lambs in a field as they were eating a meal of lamb . Soon after , the couple became outspoken animal rights activists . In his first interview after Linda 's death , he promised to continue working for animal rights , and in 1999 he spent £ 3 , 000 , 000 to ensure Linda McCartney Foods remained free of genetically engineered ingredients . In 1995 , he narrated the documentary Devour the Earth , written by Tony Wardle . McCartney is a supporter of the animal - rights organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals . He has appeared in the group 's campaigns and , in 2009 , he narrated a short factory farm exposé titled " Glass Walls . " McCartney has also supported campaigns headed by the Humane Society of the United States , Humane Society International , the World Society for the Protection of Animals , and the David Shepherd Wildlife Foundation . Following McCartney 's marriage to Mills , he joined her in a campaign against landmines , becoming a patron of Adopt - A - Minefield . He wore an anti - landmines T - shirt during some of the Back in the World tour shows . In 2006 , the McCartneys travelled to Prince Edward Island to raise international awareness of seal hunting . The couple debated with Danny Williams , Newfoundland 's then Premier , on Larry King Live , stating that fishermen should stop hunting seals and start seal - watching businesses instead . McCartney also supports the Make Poverty History campaign . McCartney has participated in several charity recordings and performances , including the Concerts for the People of Kampuchea , Ferry Aid , Band Aid , Live Aid and the recording of " Ferry Cross the Mersey " . In 2004 , he donated a song to an album to aid the " US Campaign for Burma " , in support of Burmese Nobel Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi .

She attended Cushing Academy , a boarding school in Ashburnham , Massachusetts , where she met her future husband , Harmon O . Nelson , known as " Ham " . In 1926 , she saw a production of Henrik Ibsen 's The Wild Duck with Blanche Yurka and Peg Entwistle . Davis later recalled that it inspired her full commitment to her chosen career , and said , " Before that performance I wanted to be an actress . When it ended , I had to be an actress ... exactly like Peg Entwistle . " She auditioned for admission to Eva LeGallienne 's Manhattan Civic Repertory , but was rejected by LeGallienne who described her attitude as " insincere " and " frivolous " . She was accepted by the John Murray Anderson School of Theatre , and studied dance with Martha Graham . She auditioned for George Cukor 's stock theater company , and although he was not very impressed , he gave Davis her first paid acting assignment anyway — a one - week stint playing the part of a chorus girl in the play Broadway . She was later chosen to play Hedwig , the character she had seen Entwistle play , in The Wild Duck . After performing in Philadelphia , Washington and Boston , she made her Broadway debut in 1929 in Broken Dishes , and followed it with Solid South . A Universal Studios talent scout saw her perform and invited her to Hollywood for a screen test .

The Bad world tour began on September 12 that year , finishing on January 14 , 1989 . In Japan alone , the tour had 14 sellouts and drew 570 , 000 people , nearly tripling the previous record of 200 , 000 in a single tour . Jackson broke a Guinness World Record when 504 , 000 people attended seven sold - out shows at Wembley Stadium . He performed a total of 123 concerts to an audience of 4 . 4 million people . The Bad Tour turned out to be the last of Jackson 's concert tours to include shows in the continental United States , although later tours did make it to Hawaii . In 1988 , Jackson released his only autobiography , Moonwalk , which took four years to complete and sold 200 , 000 copies . Jackson wrote about his childhood , The Jackson 5 , and the abuse he had suffered . He also wrote about his facial appearance , saying he had had two rhinoplastic surgeries and a dimple created in his chin . He attributed much of the change in the structure of his face to puberty , weight loss , a strict vegetarian diet , a change in hair style , and stage lighting . Moonwalk reached the top position on The New York Times best sellers ' list . The musician then released a film called Moonwalker , which featured live footage and short films that starred Jackson and Joe Pesci . The film was originally intended to be released to theaters , but due to financial issues , the film was released direct - to - video . It saw a theatrical release in Germany , though . It debuted atop the Billboard Top Music Video Cassette chart , staying there for 22 weeks . It was eventually knocked off the top spot by Michael Jackson : The Legend Continues . In March 1988 , Jackson purchased land near Santa Ynez , California , to build Neverland Ranch at a cost of $ 17 million . He installed Ferris wheels , a menagerie , and a movie theater on the 2 , 700 - acre ( 11 km2 ) property . A security staff of 40 patrolled the grounds . In 2003 , it was valued at approximately $ 100 million . In 1989 , his annual earnings from album sales , endorsements , and concerts was estimated at $125 million for that year alone . Shortly afterwards , he became the first Westerner to appear in a television ad in the Soviet Union .

From February 1961 , Dylan played at various clubs around Greenwich Village . He befriended and picked up material from many folk singers in the Village scene , including Dave Van Ronk , Fred Neil , Odetta , the New Lost City Ramblers , and Irish musicians Tommy Makem and the Clancy Brothers . In September , Dylan gained some public recognition when Robert Shelton wrote a positive review in The New York Times of a show at Gerde 's Folk City . The same month Dylan played harmonica on folk singer Carolyn Hester 's eponymous third album , which brought his talents to the attention of the album 's producer , John Hammond . Hammond signed Dylan to Columbia Records in October . The performances on his first Columbia album , Bob Dylan , released in March 1962 , consisted of familiar folk , blues and gospel material combined with two original compositions . The album made little impact , selling only 5,000 copies in its first year , just enough to break even . Within Columbia Records , some referred to the singer as " Hammond 's Folly " and suggested dropping his contract . Hammond defended Dylan vigorously . In March 1962 , Dylan contributed harmonica and back - up vocals to the album Three Kings and the Queen , accompanying Victoria Spivey and Big Joe Williams on a recording for Spivey Records . While working for Columbia , Dylan also recorded several songs under the pseudonym Blind Boy Grunt , for Broadside Magazine , a folk music magazine and record label . Dylan used the pseudonym Bob Landy to record as a piano player on the 1964 anthology album , The Blues Project , issued by Elektra Records . Under the pseudonym Tedham Porterhouse , Dylan contributed harmonica to Ramblin ' Jack Elliott 's 1964 album Jack Elliott . Dylan made two important career moves in August 1962 . He legally changed his name to Bob Dylan , and signed a management contract with Albert Grossman . Grossman remained Dylan 's manager until 1970 , and was notable both for his sometimes confrontational personality , and for the fiercely protective loyalty he displayed towards his principal client . Dylan subsequently said of Grossman , " He was kind of like a Colonel Tom Parker figure ... you could smell him coming . " Tensions between Grossman and John Hammond led to Hammond being replaced as the producer of Dylan 's second album by the young African American jazz producer Tom Wilson .

Ono began telephoning and calling at Lennon 's home , and when his wife asked for an explanation , he explained that Ono was only trying to obtain money for her " avant - garde bullshit " . In May 1968 , while his wife was on holiday in Greece , Lennon invited Ono to visit . They spent the night recording what would become the Two Virgins album , after which , he said , they " made love at dawn . " When Lennon 's wife returned home she found Ono wearing her bathrobe and drinking tea with Lennon who simply said , " Oh , hi . " Ono became pregnant in 1968 and miscarried a male child they named John Ono Lennon II on 21 November 1968 , a few weeks after Lennon 's divorce from Cynthia was granted . During Lennon 's last two years in the Beatles , he and Ono began public protests against the Vietnam War . They were married at The Rock Hotel in Gibraltar on 20 March 1969 , and spent their honeymoon at the Amsterdam Hilton Hotel in Amsterdam campaigning with a week - long Bed - In for peace . They planned another Bed - In in the United States , but were denied entry , so held one instead at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal , where they recorded " Give Peace a Chance " . They often combined advocacy with performance art , as in their " Bagism " , first introduced during a Vienna press conference . Lennon detailed this period in the Beatles ' song " The Ballad of John and Yoko " . Lennon changed his name by deed poll on 22 April 1969 , adding " Ono " as a middle name . The brief ceremony took place on the roof of the Apple Corps building , made famous three months earlier by The Beatles ' Let It Be rooftop concert . Although he used the name John Ono Lennon thereafter , official documents referred to him as John Winston Ono Lennon , since he was not permitted to revoke a name given at birth . The couple settled at Tittenhurst Park at Sunninghill in Berkshire . After Ono was injured in a car accident , Lennon arranged for a king - sized bed to be brought to the recording studio as he worked on the Beatles ' last album , Abbey Road . To escape the acrimony of the band 's break - up , Ono suggested they move permanently to New York , which they did on 31 August 1971 .

John and Yoko add a great voice and drive to the country 's so - called art institution . They inspire and transcend and stimulate and by doing so , only help others to see pure light and in doing that , put an end to this dull taste of petty commercialism which is being passed off as Artist Art by the overpowering mass media . Hurray for John and Yoko . Let them stay and live here and breathe . The country 's got plenty of room and space . Let John and Yoko stay ! On 23 March 1973 , Lennon was ordered to leave the US within 60 days . Ono , meanwhile , was granted permanent residence . In response , Lennon and Ono held a press conference on 1 April 1973 at the New York City Bar Association , where they announced the formation of the state of Nutopia ; a place with " no land , no boundaries , no passports , only people " . Waving the white flag of Nutopia ( two handkerchiefs ) , they asked for political asylum in the US . The press conference was filmed , and would later appear in the 2006 documentary The U.S . vs . John Lennon . Lennon 's Mind Games ( 1973 ) included the track " Nutopian International Anthem " , which comprised three seconds of silence . Soon after the press conference , Nixon 's involvement in a political scandal came to light , and in June the Watergate hearings began in Washington , DC . They led to the president 's resignation 14 months later . Nixon 's successor , Gerald Ford , showed little interest in continuing the battle against Lennon , and the deportation order was overturned in 1975 . The following year , his US immigration status finally resolved , Lennon received his " green card " certifying his permanent residency , and when Jimmy Carter was inaugurated as president in January 1977 , Lennon and Ono attended the Inaugural Ball . After Lennon 's death , historian Jon Wiener filed a Freedom of Information Act request for FBI files documenting the Bureau 's role in the deportation attempt . The FBI admitted it had 281 pages of files on Lennon , but refused to release most of them on the grounds that they contained national security information . In 1983 , Wiener sued the FBI with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California . It took 14 years of litigation to force the FBI to release the withheld pages . The ACLU , representing Wiener , won a favourable decision in their suit against the FBI in the Ninth Circuit in 1991 . The Justice Department appealed the decision to the Supreme Court in April 1992 , but the court declined to review the case . In 1997 , respecting President Bill Clinton 's newly instigated rule that documents should be withheld only if releasing them would involve " foreseeable harm " , the Justice Department settled most of the outstanding issues outside court by releasing all but 10 of the contested documents . Wiener published the results of his 14 - year campaign in January 2000 . Gimme Some Truth : The John Lennon FBI Files contained facsimiles of the documents , including " lengthy reports by confidential informants detailing the daily lives of anti - war activists , memos to the White House , transcripts of TV shows on which Lennon appeared , and a proposal that Lennon be arrested by local police on drug charges " . The story is told in the documentary The U.S . vs . John Lennon . The final 10 documents in Lennon 's FBI file , which reported on his ties with London anti-war activists in 1971 and had been withheld as containing " national security information provided by a foreign government under an explicit promise of confidentiality " , were released in December 2006 . They contained no indication that the British government had regarded Lennon as a serious threat ; one example of the released material was a report that two prominent British leftists had hoped Lennon would finance a left - wing bookshop and reading room .

Since Woman of the Year Hepburn had committed to a romantic relationship with Tracy and dedicated herself to helping the star , who suffered from alcoholism and insomnia . Her career slowed as a result , and she worked less for the remainder of the decade than she had done in the 1930s — notably by not appearing on - stage again until 1950 . Her only appearance in 1943 was a cameo in the morale - building wartime film Stage Door Canteen , playing herself . She took an atypical role in 1944 , playing a Chinese peasant in the high - budget drama Dragon Seed . Hepburn was enthusiastic about the film , but it met with a tepid response and she was described as miscast . She then reunited with Tracy for the film version of Without Love ( 1945 ) , after which she turned down a role in The Razor 's Edge to support Tracy through his return to Broadway . Without Love received poor reviews , but a new Tracy – Hepburn picture was a big event and it was popular on release , selling a record number of tickets over Easter weekend 1945 . Hepburn 's next film was Undercurrent ( 1946 ) , a film noir with Robert Taylor and Robert Mitchum that was poorly received . A fourth film with Tracy came in 1947 : a drama set in the American Old West entitled The Sea of Grass . Similarly to Keeper of the Flame and Without Love , a lukewarm response from critics did not stop it from being a financial success both at home and abroad . The same year , Hepburn portrayed Clara Wieck Schumann in Song of Love . She trained intensively with a pianist for the role . By the time of its release in October , Hepburn 's career had been significantly affected by her public opposition to the growing anti - communist witch - hunt in Hollywood . Viewed by some as dangerously progressive , she was not offered work for nine months and people reportedly threw things at screenings of Song of Love . Her next film role came unexpectedly , as she agreed to replace Claudette Colbert only days before shooting began on Frank Capra 's political drama State of the Union ( 1948 ) . Tracy had long been signed to play the male lead , and so Hepburn was already familiar with the script and stepped up for the fifth Tracy – Hepburn picture . Critics responded positively to the film and it performed well at the box office .

That same year , Bana made his film debut in the Australian film The Castle , which tells the story of a Melbourne - based family 's struggles to keep their home by Melbourne 's airport as the airport authority force them to move . He was featured in a supporting role as Con Petropoulous , a kickboxing accountant who is the householder 's son - in - law . The Castle was a surprise critical and financial success , earning A $ 10 , 326 , 428 at the box office in Australia . In 1997 , in spite of his lack of experience in dramatic roles , Bana was approached by director Andrew Dominik to appear in the film Chopper ( 2000 ) , a biopic based on the life of infamous Australian criminal Chopper Read . Dominik had been working on the project for five years , but was unable to find an actor to portray Read . Only after Read himself suggested Bana , having seen him perform a skit on television , did Dominik consider him for the part . For the role , Bana shaved his head , gained thirty pounds , and spent two days with Read to perfect his mimicry . During filming he arrived on set at four in the morning and spent five hours being covered in Read 's trademark tattoos . In spite of the film 's limited release outside of Australia , Bana 's performance received positive reviews . American film critic Roger Ebert complimented Bana , stating that " in a comedian named Eric Bana the filmmakers have found , I think , a future star ... He has a quality no acting school can teach you and few actors can match . You cannot look away from him " . Chopper was a critical and financial success in Australia , and was nominated for Best Film at the Australian Film Institute Awards in 2001 . Bana 's performance won the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actor . In 2001 , director Ridley Scott cast Bana as an American soldier in the film Black Hawk Down ( 2001 ) . Scott , impressed by Bana 's performance in Chopper , did not require him to audition . In the film , he played Sergeant First Class Norm ' Hoot ' Gibson , an elite Delta Force soldier , who fights his way out of a battle in Mogadishu , Somalia after a mission to capture two top lieutenants of a renegade warlord goes awry . Bana shed the weight he had gained for Chopper and began an exercise regimen months before filming began . He also trained with Delta Force operators at Fort Bragg , learning to fire weapons and clear rooms .

Buckley says of Bowie : " His influence has been unique in popular culture — he has permeated and altered more lives than any comparable figure . " In the BBC 's 2002 poll of the 100 Greatest Britons , Bowie was placed at number 29 . Throughout his career , he has sold an estimated 140 million albums . In the UK , he has been awarded nine Platinum album certifications , 11 Gold and eight Silver , and in the US , five Platinum and seven Gold certifications . In 2004 , Rolling Stone ranked him 39th on their list of the " 100 Greatest Artists of All Time " , and 23rd on their list of the best singers of all time . David Bowie was born David Robert Jones in Brixton , London , on 8 January 1947 . His Irish mother , Margaret Mary " Peggy " ( née Burns ) , worked as a cinema usherette , while his father , Haywood Stenton " John " Jones , was a promotions officer for Barnardo 's . The family lived at 40 Stansfield Road , located near the border of the south London areas of Brixton and Stockwell . Bowie attended Stockwell Infants School until he was six years old , acquiring a reputation as a gifted and single - minded child — and a defiant brawler . In 1953 the family moved to the suburb of Bromley , where , two years later , Bowie progressed to Burnt Ash Junior School . His voice was considered " adequate " by the school choir , and his recorder playing judged to demonstrate above-average musical ability . At the age of nine , his dancing during the newly introduced music and movement classes was strikingly imaginative : teachers called his interpretations " vividly artistic " and his poise " astonishing " for a child . The same year , his interest in music was further stimulated when his father brought home a collection of American 45s by artists including Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers , The Platters , Fats Domino , Elvis Presley and Little Richard . Upon listening to " Tutti Frutti " , Bowie would later say , " I had heard God " . Presley 's impact on him was likewise emphatic : " I saw a cousin of mine dance to ... ' Hound Dog ' and I had never seen her get up and be moved so much by anything . It really impressed me , the power of the music . I started getting records immediately after that . " By the end of the following year he had taken up the ukulele and tea - chest bass and begun to participate in skiffle sessions with friends , and had started to play the piano ; meanwhile his stage presentation of numbers by both Presley and Chuck Berry — complete with gyrations in tribute to the original artists — to his local Wolf Cub group was described as " mesmerizing ... like someone from another planet . " Failing his eleven plus exam at the conclusion of his Burnt Ash Junior education , Bowie joined Bromley Technical High School .

In 905 NBA games , Johnson tallied 17,707 points , 6,559 rebounds , and 10,141 assists , translating to career averages of 19.5 points , 7.2 rebounds , and 11.2 assists per game , the highest assists per game average in NBA history . Johnson shares the single - game playoff record for assists ( 24 ) , holds the Finals record for assists in a game ( 21 ) , and has the most playoff assists ( 2,346 ) . He holds the All - Star Game single - game record for assists ( 22 ) , and the All - Star Game record for career assists ( 127 ) . Johnson introduced a fast - paced style of basketball called " Showtime " , described as a mix of " no - look passes off the fastbreak , pin - point alley - oops from halfcourt , spinning feeds and overhand bullets under the basket through triple teams . " Fellow Lakers guard Michael Cooper said , " There have been times when [ Johnson ] has thrown passes and I was n't sure where he was going . Then one of our guys catches the ball and scores , and I run back up the floor convinced that he must 've thrown it through somebody . " Johnson was exceptional because he played point guard despite being 6 ft 9 in ( 2.06 m ) , a size reserved normally for frontcourt players . He combined the size of a power forward , the one - on - one skills of a swingman , and the ball handling talent of a guard , making him one of the most dangerous triple - double threats of all time ; his 138 triple - double games are second only to Oscar Robertson 's 181 . For his feats , Johnson was voted as one of the 50 Greatest Players of All Time by the NBA in 1996 , and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2002 . ESPN 's SportsCentury ranked Johnson # 17 in their " 50 Greatest Athletes of the 20th Century " In 2006 , ESPN.com rated Johnson the greatest point guard of all time , stating , " It could be argued that he 's the one player in NBA history who was better than Michael Jordan . " Several of his achievements in individual games have also been named among the top moments in the NBA .

Jennings was born on July 29 , 1938 , in Toronto , Ontario , Canada ; he and his younger sister Sarah were children of Elizabeth ( Osborne ) and Charles Jennings , a prominent radio broadcaster for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation ( CBC ) . Peter Jennings started his broadcasting career at the age of nine , hosting Peter 's People , a half - hour , Saturday morning , CBC Radio show for kids . His father was on a business trip to the Middle East when the show debuted ; upon returning , Charles Jennings , who harbored a deep dislike of nepotism , was outraged to learn that the network had put his son on the air . When Jennings was 11 , he started attending Trinity College School in Port Hope , Ontario , where he excelled in sports . After the CBC moved his father to its Ottawa headquarters in the early 1950s , Jennings transferred to Lisgar Collegiate Institute . He struggled academically , and Jennings later surmised that it was out of " pure boredom " that he failed 10th grade and dropped out . " I loved girls , " he said . " I loved comic books . And for reasons I do n't understand , I was pretty lazy . " Jennings then briefly attended Carleton University , where he says he " lasted about 10 minutes " before dropping out . He also attended the University of Ottawa . Although Jennings dreamed of following in his father 's footsteps in broadcasting , his first job was as a bank teller for the Royal Bank of Canada . He had hoped that the company would assign him to its Havana branch ; instead , it located him in the small town of Prescott , Ontario , before transferring him to its nearby Brockville branch . During this time , he explored acting by appearing in several amateur musical productions with the Orpheus Musical Theatre Society , including Damn Yankees and South Pacific . It was in Brockville that the 21 - year - old Jennings started his rise in broadcasting . In 1959 , CFJR , a local radio station , hired him as a member of its news department ; many of his stories , including his coverage of a local train wreck , were picked up by the CBC . By 1961 , Jennings had joined the staff of CJOH - TV , then a new television station in Ottawa . When the station launched in March 1961 , Jennings was initially an interviewer and co - producer for Vue , a late - night news program . His producers saw a youthful attractiveness in him that resembled that of Dick Clark , and Jennings soon found himself hosting Club Thirteen , a dance show similar to American Bandstand .

Beginning in 1955 , Garland appeared in a number of television specials . The first , the 1955 debut episode of Ford Star Jubilee , was the first full - scale color broadcast ever on CBS and was a ratings triumph , scoring a 34.8 Nielsen rating . She signed a three - year , $ 300,000 contract with the network . Only one additional special , a live concert edition of General Electric Theater , was broadcast in 1956 before the relationship between the Lufts and CBS broke down in a dispute over the planned format of upcoming specials . In 1956 , Garland performed four weeks at the New Frontier Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip for a salary of $ 55,000 per week , making her the highest - paid entertainer to work in Las Vegas . Despite a brief bout of laryngitis , her performances there were so successful that her run was extended an extra week . Later that year she returned to the Palace Theatre , site of her two - a - day triumph . She opened in September , once again to rave reviews and popular acclaim . In November 1959 , Garland was hospitalized , diagnosed with acute hepatitis . Over the next few weeks several quarts of fluid were drained from her body until , still weak , she was released from the hospital in January 1960 . She was told by doctors that she likely had five years or less to live , and that even if she did survive she would be a semi - invalid and would never sing again . She initially felt " greatly relieved " at the diagnosis . " The pressure was off me for the first time in my life . " However , she recovered over the next several months and , in August of that year , returned to the stage of the Palladium . She felt so warmly embraced by the British that she announced her intention to move permanently to England . Her concert appearance at Carnegie Hall on April 23 , 1961 , was a considerable highlight , called by many " the greatest night in show business history " . The two - record Judy at Carnegie Hall was certified gold , charting for 95 weeks on Billboard , including 13 weeks at number one . The album won four Grammy Awards including Album of the Year and Best Female Vocal of the Year . The album has never been out of print .

Along with Sean Penn , John Malkovich and Mick Hucknall , Depp co - owned the French restaurant - bar Man Ray , located near the Champs - Élysées . In July 2012 , Depp announced he would be co - editor , alongside Douglas Brinkley , of folk singer Woody Guthrie 's unpublished novel " House of Earth " , scheduled for release in 2013 . Depp was married to Lori Anne Allison from 1983 to 1985 . He was later successively engaged to actresses Jennifer Grey and Sherilyn Fenn in the late 1980s before proposing in 1990 to his Edward Scissorhands co-star Winona Ryder , for whom he tattooed " WINONA FOREVER " on his right arm . In 1998 , following a four-year relationship with British supermodel Kate Moss , Depp began a relationship with Vanessa Paradis , a French actress and singer whom he met while filming The Ninth Gate . After months of media speculation , Depp and Paradis announced their separation in June 2012 . Depp has two children with Paradis : daughter Lily - Rose Melody Depp ( born 1999 ) , and son John " Jack " Christopher Depp III ( born 2002 ) . In 2007 , Depp 's daughter recovered from a serious illness , an E. coli infection that began to cause her kidneys to shut down and resulted in an extended hospital stay . To thank Great Ormond Street Hospital , Depp visited the hospital in November 2007 , dressed in his Captain Jack Sparrow outfit , and spent four hours reading stories to the children . In 2008 he donated £ 1million ( about $ 2million ) to the hospital . Although Depp has not remarried , he has stated that having children has given him " real foundation , a real strong place to stand in life , in work , in everything . " " You ca n't plan the kind of deep love that results in children . Fatherhood was not a conscious decision . It was part of the wonderful ride I was on . It was destiny ; kismet . All the math finally worked . " While with Paradis , Depp divided his time amongst their home in Meudon , located in the suburbs of Paris ; two homes in Los Angeles ; an island he bought in The Bahamas ; their £ 500 , 000 ( $1m ) townhouse in Bath , Somerset and their villa in Le Plan - de - la - Tour , a small town 20 km from Saint - Tropez , in the south of France . Depp also acquired a vineyard estate in the Plan - de - la - Tour area in 2007 . Several reports indicated Depp bought Burnham Westgate Hall in Norfolk , England , a 13 - bedroom Georgian country house , in June 2011 .

With the gift of a guitar from his mother when he was 12 , Depp began playing in various garage bands . A year after his parents ' divorce , Depp dropped out of high school to become a rock musician . He attempted to go back to school two weeks later , but the principal told him to follow his dream of being a musician . He played with The Kids , a band that enjoyed modest local success . The Kids set out together for Los Angeles in pursuit of a record deal , changing their name to Six Gun Method , but the group split up before signing a record deal . Depp subsequently collaborated with the band Rock City Angels and co - wrote their song " Mary " , which appeared on Rock City Angels ' debut for Geffen Records titled Young Man 's Blues . On December 24 , 1983 , Depp married Lori Anne Allison , the sister of his band 's bass player and singer . During Depp 's marriage , his wife worked as a makeup artist , while he worked a variety of odd jobs , including a telemarketer for pens . His wife introduced him to actor Nicolas Cage , who advised Depp to pursue an acting career . Depp and his wife divorced in 1985 . Both Depp and his subsequent fiancé Sherilyn Fenn auditioned for the 1986 film Thrashin ' and they were both cast , with Depp being chosen by the film 's director to star as the lead , which would have been Depp 's second major role . Depp was later turned down by the film 's producer , who rejected the director 's decision . Depp starred in a lead role on the Fox television series , 21 Jump Street , which premiered in 1987 . Depp accepted this role to work with actor Frederic Forrest , who inspired him . Depp 's long - time friend Sal Jenco joined the cast as a semi - co - star as the janitor named Blowfish . The series ' success turned Depp into a popular teen idol during the late 1980s . Despite this success , Depp felt " forced into the role of product . " Depp subsequently decided to appear only in films that he felt were right for him . Depp and his co - stars , Peter DeLuise and Holly Robinson , briefly reprised their roles in cameo appearances in the series ' 2012 feature film adaptation , which featured a much more comedic tone than the series .

Gyllenhaal expressed mixed feelings about the experience of being directed by Ang Lee in Brokeback Mountain , but generally had more praise than criticism for Lee 's directing style . While complaining of the way Lee tended to disconnect from his actors once filming began , Gyllenhaal praised his encouraging direction of the actors and sensitive approach to the material . At the Directors Guild of America Awards on January 28 , 2006 , Gyllenhaal also praised Lee for " his humbleness and his respect for everyone around him . " When asked about his kissing scenes with Heath Ledger in Brokeback Mountain , Gyllenhaal said , " As an actor , I think we need to embrace the times we feel most uncomfortable . " When asked about the more intimate scenes with Ledger , Gyllenhaal likened them to " doing a sex scene with a woman I 'm not particularly attracted to . " Following the release of Brokeback Mountain , rumors circulated regarding the actor 's sexual orientation . When asked about such gossip during an interview , Gyllenhaal said : You know it 's flattering when there 's a rumor that says I 'm bisexual . It means I can play more kinds of roles . I 'm open to whatever people want to call me . I 've never really been attracted to men sexually , but I do n't think I would be afraid of it if it happened . Gyllenhaal narrated the 2005 short animated film The Man Who Walked Between the Towers , based on Mordicai Gerstein 's book of the same name about Philippe Petit 's famous stunt . In January 2007 , as host of Saturday Night Live , he put on a sparkly evening dress and sang " And I Am Telling You I 'm Not Going " from the musical Dreamgirls for his opening monologue , dedicating the song to his " unique fan base ... the fans of Brokeback . " In 2007 , Gyllenhaal starred in David Fincher 's Zodiac , which was based on a true story . He played Robert Graysmith , a San Francisco Chronicle cartoonist and author of two books about the Zodiac serial killer . Gyllenhaal starred opposite Meryl Streep , Alan Arkin , and Reese Witherspoon in the October 2007 release Rendition , a Gavin Hood - directed political thriller about the U . S . policy of extraordinary rendition . In 2009 , he appeared with Tobey Maguire in Jim Sheridan 's remake of Susanne Bier 's 2004 Danish language film Brothers . In 2008 , it was announced that Gyllenhaal would star in the comedy Nailed , which he filmed in South Carolina with Jessica Biel , as well as Doug Liman 's as yet untitled film about the race for lunar colonization . The following year , Gyllenhaal played the lead role in the movie adaptation of the video game Prince of Persia : The Sands of Time , produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and released by Disney on May 28 , 2010 and in the romantic comedy Love and Other Drugs , released on November 24 , 2010 , for which he received a Golden Globe Award nomination .

Hepburn stayed active throughout the 1970s , focusing on roles described by Andrew Britton as " either a devouring mother or a batty old lady living [ alone ] " . First she traveled to Spain to film a version of Euripides ' The Trojan Women ( 1971 ) alongside Vanessa Redgrave . When asked why she had taken the role , she responded that she wanted to broaden her range and try everything while she still had time . The movie was poorly received , but the Kansas City Film Critics named Hepburn 's performance the best from an actress that year . In 1971 she signed on to star in an adaptation of Graham Greene 's Travels With My Aunt , but was unhappy with early versions of the script and took to rewriting it herself . The studio disliked her changes , so Hepburn abandoned the project and was replaced with Maggie Smith . Her next film , an adaptation of Edward Albee 's A Delicate Balance ( 1973 ) directed by Tony Richardson , had a small release and received generally unfavorable reviews . She then ventured into television for the first time , in a production of Tennessee Williams' The Glass Menagerie . Hepburn had been wary of the medium but it proved to be one of the main television events of 1973 , scoring high in the Nielsen ratings . Hepburn received an Emmy Award nomination for playing wistful Southern mother Amanda Wingfield , which opened her mind to future work on the small screen . Her next project was the television movie Love Among the Ruins ( 1975 ) , a London - based Edwardian drama with her friend Laurence Olivier . It received positive reviews and high ratings , and earned Hepburn her only Emmy Award .

The Beatles evolved from Lennon 's first band , the Quarrymen . Named after Quarry Bank High School , the group was established by him in September 1956 when he was 15 , and began as a skiffle group . By the summer of 1957 the Quarrymen played a " spirited set of songs " made up of half skiffle and half rock and roll . Lennon first met Paul McCartney at the Quarrymen 's second performance , held in Woolton on 6 July at the St. Peter 's Church garden fête , after which McCartney was asked to join the band . McCartney says that Aunt Mimi : " was very aware that John 's friends were lower class " , and would often patronise him when he arrived to visit Lennon . According to Paul 's brother Mike , McCartney 's father was also disapproving , declaring Lennon would get his son " into trouble " ; although he later allowed the fledgling band to rehearse in the McCartneys ' front room at 20 Forthlin Road . During this time , the 18 - year - old Lennon wrote his first song , " Hello Little Girl " , a UK top 10 hit for The Fourmost nearly five years later . George Harrison joined the band as lead guitarist , even though Lennon thought Harrison ( at 14 years old ) was too young to join the band , so McCartney engineered a second audition on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus , where Harrison played " Raunchy " for Lennon . Stuart Sutcliffe , Lennon 's friend from art school , later joined as bassist . Lennon , McCartney , Harrison and Sutcliffe became " The Beatles " in early 1960 . In August that year , the Beatles engaged for a 48 - night residency in Hamburg , Germany , and desperately in need of a drummer , asked Pete Best to join them . Lennon was now 19 , and his aunt , horrified when he told her about the trip , pleaded with him to continue his art studies instead . After the first Hamburg residency , the band accepted another in April 1961 , and a third in April 1962 . Like the other band members , Lennon was introduced to Preludin while in Hamburg , and regularly took the drug , as well as amphetamines , as a stimulant during their long , overnight performances .

Ruth Elizabeth " Bette " Davis ( April 5 , 1908 – October 6 , 1989 ) was an American actress of film , television and theater . Noted for her willingness to play unsympathetic characters , she was highly regarded for her performances in a range of film genres , from contemporary crime melodramas to historical and period films and occasional comedies , although her greatest successes were her roles in romantic dramas . After appearing in Broadway plays , Davis moved to Hollywood in 1930 , but her early films for Universal Studios ( and as loanout to other studios ) were unsuccessful . She joined Warner Bros. in 1932 and established her career with several critically acclaimed performances . In 1937 , she attempted to free herself from her contract and although she lost a well - publicized legal case , it marked the beginning of the most successful period of her career . Until the late 1940s , she was one of American cinema 's most celebrated leading ladies , known for her forceful and intense style . Davis gained a reputation as a perfectionist who could be highly combative , and confrontations with studio executives , film directors and costars were often reported . Her forthright manner , clipped vocal style and ubiquitous cigarette contributed to a public persona which has often been imitated and satirized .

In September 2006 , the pilot for Studio 60 aired on NBC , directed by Schlamme . The pilot was critically acclaimed and viewed by over 12 million people , but Studio 60 experienced a significant drop in audience by mid - season . The seething anticipation that preceded the début was followed up by a large amount of thoughtful and scrupulous criticism in the press , as well as largely negative analysis in the blogosphere . In January 2007 , Sorkin spoke out against the press for focusing too heavily on the ratings slide and for using blogs and unemployed comedy writers as sources . After two months on hiatus , Studio 60 resumed to air the last episodes of season one , which would be its only season .

Sorkin came up with the idea to write about the behind - the - scenes happenings on a sports show while he was living in a room in the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles writing the screenplay for The American President . He would work late , with the TV tuned into ESPN , watching continuous replays of SportsCenter . The show inspired him to try to write a feature film about a sports show but he was unable to structure the story for film , so instead he turned his idea into a TV comedy series . Sports Night was produced by Disney and debuted on the Disney - owned ABC network in the fall of 1998 . Sorkin fought with the ABC network during the first season over the use of a laugh track and a live studio audience . The laugh track was widely decried by critics as jarring , with Joyce Millman of Salon.com describing it as " the most unconvincing laugh track you 've ever heard " . Sorkin commented that : " Once you do shoot in front of a live audience , you have no choice but to use the laugh track . Oftentimes [ enhancing the laughs ] is the right thing to do . Sometimes you do need a cymbal crash . Other times , it alienates me . " The laugh track was gradually dialed down and was gone by the end of the first season . Sorkin was triumphant in the second season when ABC agreed to his demands , unburdening the crew of the difficulties of staging a scene for a live audience and leaving the cast with more time to rehearse . Although Sports Night was critically acclaimed , ABC canceled the show after two seasons due to its low ratings . Sorkin entertained offers to continue the show on other television channels but declined all the offers as they were mainly contingent on his involvement which would have been a difficult prospect given that he was simultaneously writing The West Wing at that point .

After more than a decade away from the theatre , Sorkin returned to adapt for the stage his screenplay The Farnsworth Invention , which started a workshop run at La Jolla Playhouse in February 2007 and which opened on Broadway in December 2007 . He was a cocaine addict for many years , but after a highly publicized arrest in 2001 he received treatment in a drug diversion program and is reported to have recovered . In television , Sorkin is known as a controlling writer , who rarely shares the credit of penning screenplays . His writing staff are more likely to do research and come up with stories for him to tell . His trademark rapid - fire dialogue and extended monologues are complemented , in television , by frequent collaborator Thomas Schlamme 's characteristic directing technique called the " walk and talk " . These sequences consist of single tracking shots of long duration involving multiple characters engaging in conversation as they move through the set ; characters enter and exit the conversation as the shot continues without any cuts . Sorkin was born in Manhattan and raised in the wealthy suburb of Scarsdale , New York . His mother was a school teacher and his father a copyright lawyer who had fought in WWII and put himself through college on the G.I . Bill ; both his older sister and brother went on to become lawyers . His paternal grandfather was one of the founders of the International Ladies ' Garment Workers ' Union ( ILGWU ) . Sorkin took an early interest in acting . Before he reached his teenage years , his parents were taking him to the theatre to see shows such as Who 's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? and That Championship Season .

Lennon left the group in September 1969 , and agreed not to inform the media while the band renegotiated their recording contract , but he was outraged that McCartney publicised his own departure on releasing his debut solo album in April 1970 . Lennon 's reaction was , " Jesus Christ ! He gets all the credit for it ! " He later wrote , " I started the band . I disbanded it . It 's as simple as that . " In later interviews with Rolling Stone magazine , he revealed his bitterness towards McCartney , saying , " I was a fool not to do what Paul did , which was use it to sell a record . " He spoke too of the hostility he perceived the other members had towards Ono , and of how he , Harrison , and Starr " got fed up with being sidemen for Paul ... After Brian Epstein died we collapsed . Paul took over and supposedly led us . But what is leading us when we went round in circles ? " In 1970 , Lennon and Ono went through primal therapy with Dr . Arthur Janov in Los Angeles , California . Designed to release emotional pain from early childhood , the therapy entailed two half - days a week with Janov for four months ; he had wanted to treat the couple for longer , but they felt no need to continue and returned to London . Lennon 's emotional debut solo album , John Lennon / Plastic Ono Band ( 1970 ) , was received with high praise . Critic Greil Marcus remarked , " John 's singing in the last verse of ' God ' may be the finest in all of rock . " The album featured the songs " Mother " , in which Lennon confronted his feelings of childhood rejection , and the Dylanesque " Working Class Hero " , a bitter attack against the bourgeois social system which , due to the lyric " you 're still fucking peasants " , fell foul of broadcasters . The same year , Tariq Ali 's revolutionary political views , expressed when he interviewed Lennon , inspired the singer to write " Power to the People " . Lennon also became involved with Ali during a protest against Oz magazine 's prosecution for alleged obscenity . Lennon denounced the proceedings as " disgusting fascism " , and he and Ono ( as Elastic Oz Band ) released the single " God Save Us / Do the Oz " and joined marches in support of the magazine .

Hepburn 's final appearance in a theatrically released film , and her first since Grace Quigley ten years earlier , was Love Affair ( 1994 ) . At 86 years old , she played a supporting role alongside Annette Bening and Warren Beatty . It was the only film of Hepburn 's career , other than the cameo appearance in Stage Door Canteen , in which she did not play a leading role . Roger Ebert noted that it was the first time Hepburn had looked frail , but that the " magnificent spirit " was still there and said her scenes " steal the show " . The New York Times made similar observations as they reflected on the actress 's final big - screen appearance , stating that " if she moved more slowly than before , in demeanor she was as game and modern as she had ever been " . Hepburn filmed one final role in the television movie One Christmas ( 1994 ) , for which she received a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination at 87 years old . Hepburn was known for being fiercely private , and would not give interviews or talk to fans for much of her career . She distanced herself from the celebrity lifestyle , uninterested in a social scene she saw as tedious and superficial , and she wore casual clothes that went strongly against convention in an era of glamour . She rarely appeared in public , even avoiding restaurants , and once wrestled a camera out of a photographer 's hand when he took a picture without asking . Despite this she enjoyed the fame , and confessed that she would not have liked the press to ignore her completely . The protective attitude thawed as she aged ; beginning with a two - hour long interview on The Dick Cavett Show in 1973 , Hepburn became increasingly open with the public .

Born in Los Angeles , California , Jolie is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand . She is the sister of actor James Haven , niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor , and goddaughter of actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell . On her father 's side , Jolie is of German and Slovak descent , and on her mother 's side , she is of primarily French Canadian , Dutch , and German ancestry . Like her mother , Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois ; her only known Native ancestor was a Huron woman born in 1649 . After her parents ' separation in 1976 , Jolie and her brother lived with their mother , who abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children . As a child , Jolie regularly saw movies with her mother and later explained that this had inspired her interest in acting ; she had not been influenced by her father . When she was six years old , her mother and stepfather , filmmaker Bill Day , moved the family to Palisades , New York ; they returned to Los Angeles five years later . She then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute , where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions . At the age of 14 , Jolie dropped out of her acting classes and aspired to become a funeral director . She began working as a fashion model , modeling mainly in Los Angeles , New York , and London . During this period , she wore black clothing , experimented with knife play , and went out moshing with her live-in boyfriend . Two years later , after the relationship had ended , she rented an apartment above a garage a few blocks from her mother 's home . She graduated from high school and returned to theater studies , though in recent times she has referred to this period with the observation , " I am still at heart \u2014 and always will be \u2014 just a punk kid with tattoos .

As the family grieved over Sam 's sudden passing , the success of The Jazz Singer helped establish Warner Bros . as a major studio . While Warner Bros . invested only $500,000 in the film , the studio reaped $3 million in profits . Hollywood 's five major studios , which controlled most of the nation 's movie theaters , initially attempted to block the growth of " talking pictures " . In the face of such organized opposition , Warner Bros . produced 12 " talkies " in 1928 alone . The following year , the newly formed Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recognized Warner Bros . for " revolutionizing the industry with sound " . Despite Warner Bros . 's new prosperity , Jack kept a tight rein on costs . He placed the studio 's directors on a quota system , and decreed a flat , low - key lighting style to make the sets look cheaper than they were . The studio emerged relatively unscathed from the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and produced a broad range of films , including " backstage musicals , " " crusading biopics , " " swashbucklers , " and " women 's pictures . " As Thomas Schatz observed , this repertoire was " a means of stabilizing marketing and sales , of bringing efficiency and economy into the production of some fifty feature films per year , and of distinguishing Warners ' collective output from that of its competitors " . Warner Bros . became best known , however , for its hard - hitting social dramas , whose production Jack Warner tended to support . These included gangster classics such as Little Caesar and The Public Enemy as well as the critically acclaimed I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang , starring Paul Muni . Some of these films reflected a surprising ( albeit temporary ) shift in Warner 's political outlook . By 1932 , despite his longstanding association with the Republican Party , he openly supported Democratic presidential candidate Franklin D . Roosevelt , staging a " Motion Picture and Electrical Parade Sports Pageant " at L.A . Stadium in Roosevelt 's honor . This development foreshadowed an " era in which Warner would recruit the most New Dealish ( often simultaneously the most left - wing ) writers " .

In 1998 , Chan released his final film for Golden Harvest , Who Am I ? . After leaving Golden Harvest in 1999 , he produced and starred alongside Shu Qi in Gorgeous a romantic comedy that focused on personal relationships and featured only a few martial arts sequences . Chan then helped create a PlayStation game in 2000 called Jackie Chan Stuntmaster , to which he lent his voice and performed the motion capture . He continued his Hollywood success in 2000 when he teamed up with Owen Wilson in the Western action comedy Shanghai Noon which spawned the sequel Shanghai Knights ( 2003 ) . He reunited with Chris Tucker for Rush Hour 2 ( 2001 ) which was an even bigger success than the original grossing $ 347 million worldwide . He experimented with special effects with The Tuxedo ( 2002 ) and The Medallion ( 2003 ) which were not as successful critically or commercially . In 2004 he teamed up with Steve Coogan in the big - budget loose adaptation of Jules Verne 's Around the World in 80 Days . Despite the success of the Rush Hour and Shanghai Noon films , Chan became frustrated with Hollywood over the limited range of roles and lack of control over the film - making process . In response to Golden Harvest 's withdrawal from the film industry in 2003 , Chan started his own film production company , JCE Movies Limited ( Jackie Chan Emperor Movies Limited ) in association with Emperor Multimedia Group ( EMG ) . His films have since featured an increasing number of dramatic scenes while continuing to succeed at the box office ; examples include New Police Story ( 2004 ) , The Myth ( 2005 ) and the hit film Rob-B-Hood ( 2006 ) . Chan 's next release was the third instalment in the Rush Hour series : Rush Hour 3 in August 2007 . It grossed US $ 255 million . However , it was a disappointment in Hong Kong , grossing only HK $ 3.5 million during its opening weekend . Filming of The Forbidden Kingdom ( released in 2008 ) , Chan 's first onscreen collaboration with fellow Chinese actor Jet Li , was completed on 24 August 2007 and the movie was released in April 2008 . The movie featured heavy use of effects and wires . Chan voiced Master Monkey in Kung Fu Panda ( released in June 2008 ) , appearing with Jack Black , Dustin Hoffman , and Angelina Jolie . In addition , he has assisted Anthony Szeto in an advisory capacity for the writer - director 's film Wushu , released on 1 May 2008 . The film stars Sammo Hung and Wang Wenjie as father and son .

Chan is a cultural icon , having been referenced in Ash 's song " Kung Fu " , Heavy Vegetable 's " Jackie Chan Is a Punk Rocker " , Leehom Wang 's " Long Live Chinese People " , as well as in " Jackie Chan " by Frank Chickens , and television shows Tim and Eric Awesome Show , Great Job ! , Celebrity Deathmatch and Family Guy . He has been the inspiration for manga such as Dragon Ball ( including a character with the alias " Jackie Chun " ) , the character Lei Wulong in Tekken and the fighting - type Pokémon Hitmonchan . In addition , Jackie Chan has a sponsorship deal with Mitsubishi Motors . As a result , Mitsubishi cars can be found in a number of Jackie Chan films . Furthermore , Mitsubishi honoured Chan by launching Evolution , a limited series of cars which he personally customised . A number of video games have featured Jackie Chan . Before Stuntmaster , Chan already had a game of his own , Jackie Chan 's Action Kung Fu , released in 1990 for the PC - Engine and NES . In 1995 , Chan was featured in the arcade fighting game Jackie Chan The Kung - Fu Master . In addition , a series of Japanese Jackie Chan games were released on the MSX by Pony , based on several of his films ( Project A , Project A 2 , Police Story , The Protector and Wheels On Meals ) . Chan has always wanted to be a role model to children , remaining popular with them due to his good - natured acting style . He has generally refused to play villains and has almost never used the word " fuck " in his films ( He 's only said that word in two films , The Protector and Burn , Hollywood , Burn ) , but in Rush Hour , in an attempt to be " cool " and imitate his partner Carter , who said " What 's up , my nigga ? " to a club of black men , he said the same thing when Carter was in another room and they all attacked him , so he had to pull out his fighting skills to beat them down and escape . Chan 's greatest regret in life is not having received proper education , inspiring him to fund educational institutions around the world . He funded the construction of the Jackie Chan Science Centre at the Australian National University and the establishment of schools in poor regions of China .

Entering a new school , Milam , for sixth grade in September 1946 , Presley was regarded as a loner . The following year , he began bringing his guitar in on a daily basis . He played and sang during lunchtime , and was often teased as a " trashy " kid who played hillbilly music . The family was by then living in a largely African - American neighborhood . A devotee of Mississippi Slim 's show on the Tupelo radio station WELO , Presley was described as " crazy about music " by Slim 's younger brother , a classmate of Presley ' s , who often took him into the station . Slim supplemented Presley 's guitar tuition by demonstrating chord techniques . When his protégé was 12 years old , Slim scheduled him for two on - air performances . Presley was overcome by stage fright the first time , but succeeded in performing the following week . In November 1948 , the family moved to Memphis , Tennessee . After residing for nearly a year in rooming houses , they were granted a two - bedroom apartment in the public housing complex known as the Courts . Enrolled at Humes High School , Presley received only a C in music in eighth grade . When his music teacher told him he had no aptitude for singing , he brought in his guitar the next day and sang a recent hit , " Keep Them Cold Icy Fingers Off Me " , in an effort to prove otherwise . A classmate later recalled that the teacher " agreed that Elvis was right when he said that she did n't appreciate his kind of singing . " He was generally too shy to perform openly , and was occasionally bullied by classmates who viewed him as a " mama 's boy " . In 1950 , he began practicing guitar regularly under the tutelage of Jesse Lee Denson , a neighbor two - and - a - half years his senior . They and three other boys — including two future rockabilly pioneers , brothers Dorsey and Johnny Burnette — formed a loose musical collective that played frequently around the Courts . That September , he began ushering at Loew 's State Theater . Other jobs followed during his school years : Precision Tool , Loew 's again , and MARL Metal Products .

The Oliviers returned to Britain , and Leigh toured through North Africa in 1943 . Leigh performed for troops before falling ill with a persistent cough and fevers . In 1944 , she was diagnosed as having tuberculosis in her left lung and spent several weeks in hospital before appearing to have recovered . Leigh was filming Caesar and Cleopatra ( 1945 ) when she discovered she was pregnant , but she suffered a miscarriage . She fell into a deep depression that hit the low point when she turned on Olivier , verbally and physically attacking him until she fell to the floor , sobbing . This was the first of many major breakdowns she suffered related to bipolar disorder . Olivier came to recognise the symptoms of an impending episode – several days of hyperactivity followed by a period of depression and an explosive breakdown , after which Leigh would have no memory of the event , but would be acutely embarrassed and remorseful . Leigh was well enough to resume acting in 1946 , in a successful London production of Thornton Wilder 's The Skin of Our Teeth ; but her films of this period , Caesar and Cleopatra ( 1945 ) and Anna Karenina ( 1948 ) , were not great successes . In 1947 , Olivier was knighted ; and Leigh accompanied him to Buckingham Palace for the investiture . She became Lady Olivier . ( After their divorce , according to the style granted to the divorced wife of a knight , she became known socially as Vivien , Lady Olivier . ) By 1948 , Olivier was on the board of directors for the Old Vic Theatre , and he and Leigh embarked on a six - month tour of Australia and New Zealand to raise funds for it . Olivier played the lead in Richard III and also performed with Leigh in The School for Scandal and The Skin of Our Teeth . The tour was an outstanding success and , although Leigh was plagued with insomnia and allowed her understudy to replace her for a week while she was ill , she generally withstood the demands placed upon her , with Olivier noting her ability to " charm the press . " Members of the company later recalled several quarrels between the couple , the most dramatic occurring in Christchurch when Leigh refused to go onstage . Olivier slapped her face , and Leigh slapped him in return and swore at him before she made her way to the stage . By the end of the tour , both were exhausted and ill ; and Olivier told a journalist , " You may not know it , but you are talking to a couple of walking corpses . " Later , he would comment that he " lost Vivien " in Australia .

Her early performances brought her immediate success in Britain , but she remained largely unknown in other parts of the world until the release of Gone with the Wind . In December 1939 , The New York Times wrote , " Miss Leigh 's Scarlett has vindicated the absurd talent quest that indirectly turned her up . She is so perfectly designed for the part by art and nature that any other actress in the role would be inconceivable " , and as her fame escalated , she was featured on the cover of Time magazine as Scarlett . In 1969 , critic Andrew Sarris commented that the success of the film had been largely due to " the inspired casting " of Leigh , and in 1998 wrote that " she lives in our minds and memories as a dynamic force rather than as a static presence . " Leonard Maltin described the film as one of the all - time greats , writing in 1998 that Leigh " brilliantly played " her role . Her performance in the West End production of A Streetcar Named Desire , described by the theatre writer Phyllis Hartnoll as " proof of greater powers as an actress than she had hitherto shown " , led to a lengthy period during which she was considered one of the finest actresses in British theatre . Discussing the subsequent film version , Pauline Kael wrote that Leigh and Marlon Brando gave " two of the greatest performances ever put on film " and that Leigh 's was " one of those rare performances that can truly be said to evoke both fear and pity . " Kenneth Tynan ridiculed Leigh 's performance opposite Olivier in the 1955 production of Titus Andronicus , commenting that she " receives the news that she is about to be ravished on her husband 's corpse with little more than the mild annoyance of one who would have preferred foam rubber . " He was one of several critics to react negatively to her reinterpretation of Lady Macbeth in 1955 , saying that her performance was insubstantial and lacked the necessary fury demanded of the role ; however , after her death he revised his opinion , describing his earlier criticism as " one of the worst errors of judgment " he had ever made . He came to believe that Leigh 's interpretation , in which Lady Macbeth uses her sexual allure to keep Macbeth enthralled , " made more sense [ ... ] than the usual battle - axe " portrayal of the character . In a survey of theatre critics conducted shortly after Leigh 's death , several named it as one of her greatest achievements in theatre .

In 1969 , a plaque to Leigh was placed in the Actors ' Church , St Paul ' s , Covent Garden , London . In 1985 , a portrait of her was included in a series of United Kingdom postage stamps , along with Sir Alfred Hitchcock , Sir Charlie Chaplin , Peter Sellers and David Niven to commemorate " British Film Year " . In April 2013 she was again included in a series of U.K. postage stamps , this time celebrating the 100th anniversary of her birth , achieving the rare accolade of a non - royal family member to appear on a British postage stamp on more than one occasion . London purchased the papers of Laurence Olivier from his estate in 1999 . Known as The Laurence Olivier Archive , the collection includes many of Vivien Leigh 's personal papers , including numerous letters she wrote to Olivier . The papers of Vivien Leigh , including letters , photographs , contracts and diaries , are owned by her daughter , Mrs. Suzanne Farrington . In 1994 , the National Library of Australia purchased a photograph album , monogrammed " L & V O " and believed to have belonged to the Oliviers , containing 573 photographs of the couple during their 1948 tour of Australia . It is now held as part of the record of the history of the performing arts in Australia .

The success of the tour encouraged the Oliviers to make their first West End appearance together , performing the same works with one addition , Antigone , included at Leigh 's insistence because she wished to play a role in a tragedy . Leigh next sought the role of Blanche DuBois in the West End stage production of Tennessee Williams 's A Streetcar Named Desire and was cast after Williams and the play 's producer Irene Mayer Selznick saw her in The School for Scandal and Antigone ; Olivier was contracted to direct . Containing a rape scene and references to promiscuity and homosexuality , the play was destined to be controversial , and the media discussion about its suitability added to Leigh 's anxiety , but she believed strongly in the importance of the work . When the West End production of Streetcar opened in October 1949 , J . B . Priestley denounced the play and Leigh 's performance ; and the critic Kenneth Tynan commented that Leigh was badly miscast because British actors were " too well - bred to emote effectively on stage " . Olivier and Leigh were chagrined that part of the commercial success of the play lay in audience members attending to see what they believed would be a salacious and sensationalist story , rather than the Greek tragedy that they envisioned ; but the play also had strong supporters , among them Noël Coward who described Leigh as " magnificent . " After 326 performances , Leigh finished her run , and she was soon engaged for the film version . Her irreverent and often bawdy sense of humour allowed her to establish a rapport with her co - star Marlon Brando , but she had difficulty with director Elia Kazan , who did not hold her in high regard as an actress . He later commented that " she had a small talent " but , as work progressed , he became " full of admiration " for " the greatest determination to excel of any actress I 've known . She 'd have crawled over broken glass if she thought it would help her performance . " Leigh found the role grueling and commented to the Los Angeles Times , " I had nine months in the theatre of Blanche DuBois . Now she 's in command of me . " Olivier accompanied her to Hollywood where he was to co - star in William Wyler 's Carrie .

Jackie Chan had vocal lessons whilst at the Peking Opera School in his childhood . He began producing records professionally in the 1980s and has gone on to become a successful singer in Hong Kong and Asia . He has released 20 albums since 1984 and has performed vocals in Cantonese , Mandarin , Japanese , Taiwanese and English . He often sings the theme songs of his films , which play over the closing credits . Chan 's first musical recording was " Kung Fu Fighting Man " , the theme song played over the closing credits of The Young Master ( 1980 ) . At least 10 of these recordings have been released on soundtrack albums for the films . His Cantonese song Story of a Hero ( 英雄故事 ) ( theme song of Police Story ) was selected by the Royal Hong Kong Police and incorporated into their recruitment advertisement in 1994 . Chan voiced the character of Shang in the Chinese release of the Walt Disney animated feature , Mulan ( 1998 ) . He also performed the song " I 'll Make a Man Out of You " , for the film 's soundtrack . For the US release , the speaking voice was performed by B . D . Wong and the singing voice was done by Donny Osmond . In 2007 , Chan recorded and released the song " We Are Ready " , the official one - year countdown song to the 2008 Summer Olympics . He performed the song at a ceremony marking the one - year countdown to the 2008 Summer Paralympics . The day before the Beijing Olympics opened , Chan released one of the two official Olympics albums , Official Album for the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games – Jackie Chan 's Version , which featured a number of special guest appearances . Chan , along with Andy Lau , Liu Huan and Wakin ( Emil ) Chau , performed " Hard to Say Goodbye " , the farewell song for the 2008 Summer Olympics closing ceremony . Jackie Chan has received worldwide recognition for his acting , having won several awards including an Innovator Award from the American Choreography Awards and a lifetime achievement award from the Taurus World Stunt Awards . He has stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and the Hong Kong Avenue of Stars . Despite considerable box office success in The Northsouth Territories , Chan 's American films have been criticised with regard to their action choreography . Reviewers of Rush Hour 2 , The Tuxedo , and Shanghai Knights criticised the toning down of Chan 's fighting scenes , citing less intensity compared to his earlier films . The comedic value of his films is questioned ; some critics stated it can be childish at times .

Presley is regarded as one of the most important figures of 20th - century popular culture . He had a versatile voice and unusually wide success encompassing many genres , including country , pop ballads , gospel , and blues . He is the best - selling solo artist in the history of popular music . Nominated for 14 competitive Grammys , he won three , and received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36 . He has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame . Elvis Presley was born on January 8 , 1935 , in Tupelo , Mississippi , to 18 - year - old Vernon Elvis and 22 - year - old Gladys Love Presley , in the two - room shotgun house built by his father in readiness for the birth . Jesse Garon Presley , his identical twin brother , was delivered stillborn 35 minutes before him . As an only child , Presley became close to both parents and formed an unusually tight bond with his mother . The family attended an Assembly of God church , where he found his initial musical inspiration . Presley 's ancestry was primarily a Western European mix : on his mother 's side , he was Scots - Irish , with some French Norman ; one of Gladys ' great - great - grandmothers was Cherokee . b His father 's forebears were of Scottish and German origin . Gladys was regarded by relatives and friends as the dominant member of the small family . Vernon moved from one odd job to the next , evidencing little ambition . The family often relied on help from neighbors and government food assistance . In 1938 , they lost their home after Vernon was found guilty of altering a check written by the landowner . He was jailed for eight months , and Gladys and Elvis moved in with relatives . In September 1941 , Presley entered first grade at East Tupelo Consolidated , where his instructors regarded him as " average " . He was encouraged to enter a singing contest after impressing his schoolteacher with a rendition of Red Foley 's country song " Old Shep " during morning prayers . The contest , held at the Mississippi - Alabama Fair and Dairy Show on October 3 , 1945 , was his first public performance : dressed as a cowboy , the ten - year - old Presley stood on a chair to reach the microphone and sang " Old Shep " . He recalled placing fifth . A few months later , Presley received his first guitar for his birthday ; he had hoped for something else — by different accounts , either a bicycle or a rifle . Over the following year , he received basic guitar lessons from two of his uncles and the new pastor at the family 's church . Presley recalled , " I took the guitar , and I watched people , and I learned to play a little bit . But I would never sing in public . I was very shy about it . "

The studio discovered a trained German Shepherd named Rin Tin Tin in 1923 . The canine made his debut in Where the North Begins , a film about an abandoned pup who is raised by wolves and befriends a fur trapper . According to one biographer , Jack Warner 's initial doubts about the project were quelled when he met Rin Tin Tin , " who seemed to display more intelligence than some of the Warner comics . " Rin Tin Tin proved to be the studio 's most important commercial asset until the introduction of sound . Screenwriter Darryl F . Zanuck produced several scripts for Rin Tin Tin vehicles and , during one year , wrote more than half of the studio 's features . Between 1928 and 1933 , Zanuck served as Jack Warner 's right - hand man and executive producer , a position whose responsibilities included the day - to - day production of films . Despite the success of Rin Tin Tin and other projects , however , Warner Bros . was unable to compete with Hollywood 's " Big Three " – Paramount , Universal , and First National studios . In 1925 , the studio expanded its operations and acquired the Brooklyn - based theater company , Vitagraph . Later that year , Sam Warner urged his brother , Harry , to sign an agreement with Western Electric to develop a series of talking " shorts " using the newly developed Vitaphone technology . Sam died of pneumonia in 1927 ( just before the premiere of the first feature - length talking picture , The Jazz Singer ) , and Jack became sole head of production . Sam 's death left Jack inconsolable . One biographer writes , " Throughout his life , Jack had been warmed by Sam 's sunshiny optimism , his thirst for excitement , his inventive mind , his gambling nature . Sam had also served as a buffer between Jack and his stern eldest brother , Harry . In the years to come , Jack ran the Warner Bros . Burbank studio with an iron hand . Following his brother 's death , he became increasingly difficult to deal with and inspired the resentment of many of his employees .

In 1988 Chan starred alongside Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao for the last time to date , in the film Dragons Forever . Hung co - directed with Corey Yuen , and the villain in the film was played by Yuen Wah , both of whom were fellow graduates of the China Drama Academy . In the late 1980s and early 90s , Chan starred in a number of successful sequels beginning with Police Story 2 , which won the award for Best Action Choreography at the 1989 Hong Kong Film Awards . This was followed by Armour of God II : Operation Condor , and Police Story 3 : Super Cop , for which Chan won the Best Actor Award at the 1993 Golden Horse Film Festival . In 1994 , Chan reprised his role as Wong Fei - hung in Drunken Master II , which was listed in Time Magazine 's All - Time 100 Movies . Another sequel , Police Story 4 : First Strike , brought more awards and domestic box office success for Chan , but did not fare as well in foreign markets . Jackie Chan rekindled his Hollywood ambitions in the 1990s , but refused early offers to play villains in Hollywood films to avoid being typecast in future roles . For example , Sylvester Stallone offered him the role of Simon Phoenix , a criminal in the futuristic film Demolition Man . Chan declined and the role was taken by Wesley Snipes . Chan finally succeeded in establishing a foothold in the North American market in 1995 with a worldwide release of Rumble in the Bronx , attaining a cult following in the United States that was rare for Hong Kong movie stars . The success of Rumble in the Bronx led to a 1996 release of Police Story 3 : Super Cop in the United States under the title Supercop , which grossed a total of US $ 16,270,600 . Jackie 's first huge blockbuster success came when he co - starred with Chris Tucker in the 1998 buddy cop action comedy Rush Hour , grossing US $ 130 million in the United States alone . This film made a star of Jackie Chan , in Hollywood . As a publicity stunt , Jackie also wrote his autobiography in collaboration with Jeff Yang entitled I Am Jackie Chan .

In 1984 , Hepburn starred in the dark comedy Grace Quigley , the story of an elderly woman who enlists a hitman ( Nick Nolte ) to kill her . Hepburn found humor in the morbid theme , but reviews were negative and the box office was poor . In 1985 , she presented a television documentary about the life and career of Spencer Tracy . The majority of Hepburn 's roles from this point were in television movies , which did not receive the critical praise of her earlier work in the medium but remained popular with audiences . With each release , Hepburn would declare it her final screen appearance , but she continued to take on new roles . She received an Emmy nomination for 1986 's Mrs . Delafield Wants to Marry , then two years later returned for the comedy Laura Lansing Slept Here , which allowed Hepburn to act with her grandniece , Schuyler Grant . In 1991 she released her autobiography , Me : Stories of my Life . It topped best-seller lists for over a year . She returned to television screens in 1992 for The Man Upstairs , co-starring Ryan O'Neal , for which she received a Golden Globe nomination . In 1994 she worked opposite Anthony Quinn in This Ca n't Be Love , which was largely based on Hepburn 's own life , with numerous references to her personality and career . These later roles have been described as " a fictional version of the typically feisty Kate Hepburn character " and critics have remarked that Hepburn was essentially playing herself .

In August , after having been introduced to the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi , the group attended a weekend of personal instruction at his Transcendental Meditation seminar in Bangor , Wales , and were informed of Epstein 's death during the seminar . " I knew we were in trouble then " , Lennon said later . " I did n't have any misconceptions about our ability to do anything other than play music , and I was scared " . They later travelled to Maharishi 's ashram in India for further guidance , where they composed most of the songs for The Beatles and Abbey Road . The anti - war , black comedy How I Won the War , featuring Lennon 's only appearance in a non – Beatles ' full - length film , was shown in cinemas in October 1967 . McCartney organised the group 's first post - Epstein project , the self - written , -produced and -directed television film Magical Mystery Tour , released in December that year . While the film itself proved to be their first critical flop , its soundtrack release , featuring Lennon 's acclaimed , Lewis Carroll - inspired " I Am the Walrus " , was a success . With Epstein gone , the band members became increasingly involved in business activities , and in February 1968 they formed Apple Corps , a multimedia corporation composed of Apple Records and several other subsidiary companies . Lennon described the venture as an attempt to achieve , " artistic freedom within a business structure " , but his increased drug experimentation and growing preoccupation with Yoko Ono , and McCartney 's own marriage plans , left Apple in need of professional management . Lennon asked Lord Beeching to take on the role , but he declined , advising Lennon to go back to making records . Lennon approached Allen Klein , who had managed The Rolling Stones and other bands during the British Invasion . Klein was appointed as Apple 's chief executive by Lennon , Harrison and Starr , but McCartney never signed the management contract . At the end of 1968 , Lennon featured in the film The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus ( not released until 1996 ) in the role of a Dirty Mac band member . The supergroup , composed of Lennon , Eric Clapton , Keith Richards and Mitch Mitchell , also backed a vocal performance by Ono in the film . Lennon and Ono were married on 20 March 1969 , and soon released a series of 14 lithographs called " Bag One " depicting scenes from their honeymoon , eight of which were deemed indecent and most of which were banned and confiscated . Lennon 's creative focus continued to move beyond the Beatles and between 1968 and 1969 he and Ono recorded three albums of experimental music together : Unfinished Music No.1 : Two Virgins ( known more for its cover than for its music ) , Unfinished Music No.2 : Life with the Lions and Wedding Album . In 1969 , they formed the Plastic Ono Band , releasing Live Peace in Toronto 1969 . In protest at Britain 's involvement in the Nigerian Civil War , Lennon returned his MBE medal to the Queen , though this had no effect on his MBE status , which could not be renounced . Between 1969 and 1970 , Lennon released the singles " Give Peace a Chance " ( widely adopted as an anti - Vietnam - War anthem in 1969 ) , " Cold Turkey " ( documenting his withdrawal symptoms after he became addicted to heroin ) and " Instant Karma ! " .

Sorkin attended Scarsdale High School where he became involved in his high school drama and theatre club . In eighth grade he played General Bullmoose in the musical Li ' l Abner . In the Scarsdale High School senior class production of Once Upon a Mattress , Sorkin played Sir Harry . In 1979 , Sorkin attended Syracuse University . In his freshman year he failed a class that was a core requirement . It was a devastating setback because he wanted to be an actor , and the Drama department did not allow students to take the stage until they completed all the core freshman classes . He returned in his sophomore year determined to do better , and graduated in 1983 with a bachelor of fine arts degree in musical theatre . After graduation , Sorkin moved to New York City where he worked odd jobs including delivering singing telegrams , driving a limousine , touring Alabama with the children 's theatre company Traveling Playhouse , handing out fliers promoting a hunting - and - fishing show , and bartending on Broadway at theatres such as the Palace Theatre . One weekend , while house sitting at a friend 's place he found an IBM Selectric typewriter , started typing , and " felt a phenomenal confidence and a kind of joy that [ he ] had never experienced before in [ his ] life .

Sorkin conceived the political TV drama The West Wing in 1997 when he went unprepared to a lunch with producer John Wells and in a panic pitched to Wells a show centered on the senior staff of the White House , using leftover ideas from his script for The American President . He told Wells about his visits to the White House while doing research for The American President , and they found themselves discussing public service and the passion of the people who serve . Wells took the concept and pitched it to the NBC network , but was told to wait because the facts behind the Lewinsky scandal were breaking and there was concern that an audience would not be able to take a show about the White House seriously . When a year later some other networks started showing interest in The West Wing , NBC decided to greenlight the series despite their previous reluctance . The pilot debuted in the fall of 1999 and was produced by Warner Bros . TV . The West Wing was honored with nine Emmy Awards for its debut season , making the show a record holder for most Emmys won by a series in a single season . Following the awards ceremony , a fiasco ensued , centered on the Emmy for writing The West Wing episode " In Excelsis Deo " which was awarded to Sorkin and Rick Cleveland , when it was reported in a The New York Times article that Cleveland had been ushered off the stage by Sorkin without being given a chance to say a few words . The story behind The West Wing episode is based on Cleveland 's father , a Korean war veteran who spent the last years of his life on the street , as Cleveland explains in his FreshYarn.com essay titled " I Was the Dumb Looking Guy with the Wire - Rimmed Glasses " . A back and forth took place between Sorkin and Cleveland in a public web forum at Mighty Big TV where Sorkin explained that he gives his writers " Story By " credit on a rotating basis " by way of a gratuity " and that he had thrown out Cleveland 's script and started from scratch . In the end , Sorkin apologized to Cleveland . Cleveland and Sorkin also won the Writers Guild of America Award for best episodic drama at the February 2001 ceremony for " In Excelsis Deo " .

Aaron Sorkin ( born June 9 , 1961 ) is an Academy and Emmy - award winning American screenwriter , producer , and playwright , whose works include A Few Good Men , The American President , The West Wing , Sports Night , Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip , Charlie Wilson 's War , The Social Network , Moneyball and The Newsroom . After graduating from Syracuse University with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Musical Theatre in 1983 , Sorkin spent much of the 1980s in New York as a struggling , sporadically employed actor . He found his passion in writing plays , and quickly established himself as a promising young playwright . His stage play A Few Good Men caught the attention of Hollywood producer David Brown , who bought the film rights before the play even premiered . Castle Rock Entertainment hired Sorkin to adapt A Few Good Men for the big screen . The film , directed by Rob Reiner , became a box office success . Sorkin spent the early 1990s writing two other screenplays at Castle Rock , Malice and The American President . In the mid - 1990s he worked as a script doctor on films such as Bulworth . In 1998 his television career began when he created the comedy series Sports Night for the ABC network . The second season of Sports Night was its last and in 1999 overlapped with the debut of Sorkin 's next TV series , the political drama The West Wing , this time for the NBC network . The West Wing won multiple Emmy Awards , and continued for three more seasons after he left the show at the end of its fourth season in 2003 . He returned to television in 2006 with the dramedy Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip , about the backstage drama at a late-night sketch comedy show , once again for the NBC network . While Sorkin 's return was met with high expectations and a lot of early online buzz before Studio 60 's premiere , NBC did not renew it after its first season in which it suffered from low ratings and mixed reception in the press and on the Internet . He also wrote the feature film screenplay for The Social Network , winning the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay .

Goldman also approached Sorkin with a story premise , which Sorkin developed into the script for Malice . Goldman oversaw the project as creative consultant while Sorkin wrote the first two drafts of Malice . Sorkin had to leave the project to finish up the script for A Few Good Men , and screenwriter Scott Frank wrote two drafts of the Malice screenplay . When production on A Few Good Men wrapped up , Sorkin took over and continued working on the script for Malice through until the final shooting script . Harold Becker directed the film , a medical thriller released in 1993 , which starred Nicole Kidman and Alec Baldwin . Malice had mixed reviews . Vincent Canby in The New York Times described the film as " deviously entertaining from its start through its finish " . Roger Ebert gave it 2 out of 4 stars , and Peter Travers in a 2000 Rolling Stone review summarized it as having " suspense but no staying power " . Sorkin 's last produced screenplay for Castle Rock was The American President and once again he worked with William Goldman , who served as a creative consultant . It took Sorkin a few years to write the screenplay for The American President , which started off as a massive 385 - page screenplay ; it was eventually whittled down to a standard shooting script of around 120 pages . Rob Reiner directed . The film was critically acclaimed . Kenneth Turan in the Los Angeles Times described the film as " genial and entertaining if not notably inspired " , and believed its most interesting aspects were the " pipe dreams about the American political system and where it could theoretically be headed " . Sorkin did uncredited script doctor work on several films in the 1990s . He wrote some quips for Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage in The Rock . He worked on Excess Baggage , a comedy about a girl who stages her own kidnapping to get her father 's attention , and rewrote some of Will Smith 's scenes in Enemy of the State . Sorkin collaborated with Warren Beatty on a couple of scripts , one of which was Bulworth . Beatty , known for occasionally personally financing his film projects through pre - production , also hired Sorkin to rewrite a script titled Ocean of Storms which never went into production . At one point Sorkin sued Beatty for proper compensation for his work on the Ocean of Storms script ; however , he eventually continued working on the script once the matter was settled .

In 2009 , McCartney wrote to Tenzin Gyatso , the 14th Dalai Lama , asking him why he was not a vegetarian . As McCartney explained , " He wrote back very kindly , saying , my doctors tell me that I must eat meat . And I wrote back again , saying , you know , I do n't think that 's right ... I think he 's now being told ... that he can get his protein somewhere else ... It just does n't seem right the Dalai Lama , on the one hand , saying , ' Hey guys , do n't harm sentient beings ... Oh , and by the way , I 'm having a steak . ' " On the eve of the 2012 U.S. Presidential Election , McCartney issued a video endorsement of President Barack Obama . In August 1967 , McCartney met the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi at the London Hilton , and later went to Bangor in North Wales , to attend a weekend initiation conference , where he and the other Beatles learned the basics of Transcendental Meditation . He explained , " The whole meditation experience was very good and I still use the mantra ... I find it soothing " . In 2009 , McCartney and Starr headlined a benefit concert at Radio City Music Hall , raising three million dollars for the David Lynch Foundation to fund instruction in Transcendental Meditation for at - risk youth . McCartney has publicly professed support for Everton , and also shown favour for Liverpool . In 2008 , he ended speculation about his allegiance when he said , " Here 's the deal : my father was born in Everton , my family are officially Evertonians , so if it comes down to a derby match or an FA Cup final between the two , I would have to support Everton . But after a concert at Wembley Arena I got a bit of a friendship with Kenny Dalglish , who had been to the gig and I thought ' You know what ? I am just going to support them both because it 's all Liverpool . ' "

Hepburn 's relentless energy and enthusiasm for life is often cited in biographies , while a headstrong independence became key to her celebrity status . This self - assuredness meant she could be controlling and difficult ; her friend Garson Kanin likened her to a schoolmistress , and she was famously blunt and outspoken . Katharine Houghton commented that her aunt could be " maddeningly self - righteous and bossy " . Hepburn confessed to being , especially early in life , " a me me me person " . She saw herself as having a happy nature , reasoning " I like life and I 've been so lucky , why should n't I be happy ? " A. Scott Berg knew Hepburn well in her later years , and said that while she was demanding , there remained a sense of humility and humanity . She led an active private life , reportedly swimming and playing tennis every morning . In her eighties she was still playing tennis regularly , as indicated in her 1993 documentary All About Me . She also enjoyed painting , which became a passion later in life . A small bust she sculpted of Spencer Tracy 's head was featured in Guess Who 's Coming to Dinner . When questioned about politics , Hepburn told an interviewer , " I always just say be on the affirmative and liberal side . Do n't be a ' no ' person . " The anti - communist hysteria in 1940s Hollywood prompted her to political activity , and she made a speech against censorship in May 1947 that shocked the public . Targeted by right - wing activists as a supposed communist sympathizer , she was mentioned at the hearings of the House Un - American Activities Committee . She insisted that the claims made about her were untrue . For decades , Hepburn openly promoted birth control and supported abortion . She found great spirituality in existence , practicing Albert Schweitzer 's theory of " Reverence for Life " , but did not believe in religion or the afterlife . In 1991 , Hepburn told a journalist , " I 'm an atheist , and that 's it . I believe there 's nothing we can know except that we should be kind to each other and do what we can for other people . " Her public declarations of these beliefs led the American Humanist Association to award her the Humanist Arts Award in 1985 .

Brian Epstein , the Beatles ' manager from 1962 , had no prior experience of artist management , but nevertheless had a strong influence on their early dress code and attitude on stage . Lennon initially resisted his attempts to encourage the band to present a professional appearance , but eventually complied , saying , " I 'll wear a bloody balloon if somebody 's going to pay me " . McCartney took over on bass after Sutcliffe decided to stay in Hamburg , and drummer Ringo Starr replaced Best , completing the four - piece line - up that would endure until the group 's break - up in 1970 . The band 's first single , " Love Me Do " , was released in October 1962 and reached No . 17 on the British charts . They recorded their debut album , Please Please Me , in under 10 hours on 11 February 1963 , a day when Lennon was suffering the effects of a cold , which is evident in the vocal on the last song to be recorded that day , Twist and Shout . The Lennon – McCartney songwriting partnership yielded eight of its fourteen tracks . With few exceptions — one being the album title itself — Lennon had yet to bring his love of wordplay to bear on his song lyrics , saying : " We were just writing songs ... pop songs with no more thought of them than that – to create a sound . And the words were almost irrelevant " . In a 1987 interview , McCartney said that the other Beatles idolised John : " He was like our own little Elvis ... We all looked up to John . He was older and he was very much the leader ; he was the quickest wit and the smartest " . The Beatles achieved mainstream success in the UK during the beginning of 1963 . Lennon was on tour when his first son , Julian , was born in April . During their Royal Variety Show performance , attended by the Queen Mother and other British royalty , Lennon poked fun at his audience : " For our next song , I 'd like to ask for your help . For the people in the cheaper seats , clap your hands ... and the rest of you , if you 'll just rattle your jewellery . " After a year of Beatlemania in the UK , the group 's historic February 1964 US debut appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show marked their breakthrough to international stardom . A two - year period of constant touring , moviemaking , and songwriting followed , during which Lennon wrote two books , In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works . The Beatles received recognition from the British Establishment when they were appointed Members of the Order of the British Empire in the Queen 's Birthday Honours of 1965 .

McCartney collaborated with Eric Stewart on Press to Play ( 1986 ) , with Stewart co - writing more than half the songs on the LP . In 1988 , McCartney released Снова в СССР , released only in the Soviet Union , which contained eighteen covers ; recorded over the course of two days . In 1989 , he joined forces with fellow Merseysiders Gerry Marsden and Holly Johnson to record an updated version of " Ferry Cross the Mersey " , for the Hillsborough disaster appeal fund . That same year , he released Flowers in the Dirt ; a collaborative effort with Elvis Costello that included musical contributions from Gilmour and Nicky Hopkins . McCartney then formed a band consisting of himself and Linda , with Hamish Stuart and Robbie McIntosh on guitars , Paul " Wix " Wickens on keyboards and Chris Whitten on drums . In September 1989 , they launched the Paul McCartney World Tour , his first in over a decade . The following year , he released the triple album , Tripping the Live Fantastic , which contained select performances from the tour . In 1990 , the US publication Amusement Business presented McCartney with an award for the highest grossing show of the year ; his two performances at Berkeley earned over $ 3 . 5 million . He performed for the largest paying stadium audience in history on 21 April 1990 , when 184,000 people attended his concert at Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil . McCartney ventured into orchestral music in 1991 , when the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Society commissioned a musical piece by him to celebrate its sesquicentennial . He collaborated with composer Carl Davis , producing Liverpool Oratorio . The performance featured opera singers Kiri Te Kanawa , Sally Burgess , Jerry Hadley and Willard White , with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir of Liverpool Cathedral . Reviews were negative . The Guardian was especially critical , describing the music as " afraid of anything approaching a fast tempo " , and adding that the piece has " little awareness of the need for recurrent ideas that will bind the work into a whole " . The paper published a letter McCartney submitted in response in which he stated , " happily , history shows that many good pieces of music were not liked by the critics of the time so I am content to ... let people judge for themselves the merits of the work . " The New York Times was slightly more generous , stating , " There are moments of beauty and pleasure in this dramatic miscellany ... the music 's innocent sincerity makes it difficult to be put off by its ambitions " . Performed around the world after its London premiere , the Liverpool Oratorio reached number one on the UK classical chart , Music Week .

After the critical success of Donnie Darko , Gyllenhaal 's next role was as Pilot Kelston in 2002 's Highway alongside Jared Leto . His performance was described by one critic as " silly , cliched and straight to video . " Gyllenhaal had more success starring opposite Jennifer Aniston in The Good Girl , which premiered at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival ; he also starred in Lovely & Amazing with Catherine Keener . In both films he plays an unstable character who begins a reckless affair with an older woman . Gyllenhaal later described these as " teenager in transition " roles . Gyllenhaal later starred in the Touchstone Pictures romantic comedy Bubble Boy , which was loosely based on the story of David Vetter . The film portrays the title character 's adventures as he pursues the love of his life before she marries the wrong man . The film was panned by critics , with one calling it an " empty - headed , chaotic , utterly tasteless atrocity " . Following Bubble Boy , Gyllenhaal starred opposite Dustin Hoffman , Susan Sarandon and Ellen Pompeo in Moonlight Mile , as a young man coping with the death of his fiancée and the grief of her parents . The story , which received mixed reviews , is loosely based on writer / director Brad Silberling 's personal experiences following the murder of girlfriend Rebecca Schaeffer . Gyllenhaal was almost cast as Spider - Man for Spider - Man 2 due to director Sam Raimi 's concerns about original Spider - Man star Tobey Maguire 's health . Maguire recovered , however , and the sequel was shot without Gyllenhaal . Instead , Gyllenhaal starred in the blockbuster The Day After Tomorrow in 2004 , co - starring Dennis Quaid as his father . In his theatrical debut , Gyllenhaal starred on the London stage in Kenneth Lonergan 's revival of This is Our Youth . Gyllenhaal said , " Every actor I look up to has done theatre work , so I knew I had to give it a try . " The play , which had been a critical sensation on Broadway , ran for eight weeks in London 's West End . Gyllenhaal received favorable critical reviews and an Evening Standard Theatre Award in the category " Outstanding Newcomer . "

During his junior year , Presley began to stand out more among his classmates , largely because of his appearance : he grew out his sideburns and styled his hair with rose oil and Vaseline . On his own time , he would head down to Beale Street , the heart of Memphis 's thriving blues scene , and gaze longingly at the wild , flashy clothes in the windows of Lansky Brothers . By his senior year , he was wearing them . Overcoming his reticence about performing outside the Courts , he competed in Humes 's Annual " Minstrel " show in April 1953 . Singing and playing guitar , he opened with " Till I Waltz Again with You " , a recent hit for Teresa Brewer . Presley recalled that the performance did much for his reputation : " I was n't popular in school ... I failed music — only thing I ever failed . And then they entered me in this talent show ... when I came onstage I heard people kind of rumbling and whispering and so forth , ' cause nobody knew I even sang . It was amazing how popular I became after that . " Presley , who never received formal music training or learned to read music , studied and played by ear . He frequented record stores with jukeboxes and listening booths . He knew all of Hank Snow 's songs and he loved records by other country singers such as Roy Acuff , Ernest Tubb , Ted Daffan , Jimmie Rodgers , Jimmie Davis , and Bob Wills . The Southern Gospel singer Jake Hess , one of his favorite performers , was a significant influence on his ballad - singing style . He was a regular audience member at the monthly All - Night Singings downtown , where many of the white gospel groups that performed reflected the influence of African - American spiritual music . He adored the music of black gospel singer Sister Rosetta Tharpe . Like some of his peers , he may have attended blues venues — of necessity , in the segregated South , only on nights designated for exclusively white audiences . He certainly listened to the regional radio stations that played " race records " : spirituals , blues , and the modern , backbeat - heavy sound of rhythm and blues . Many of his future recordings were inspired by local African - American musicians such as Arthur Crudup and Rufus Thomas . B.B . King recalled that he knew Presley before he was popular when they both used to frequent Beale Street . By the time he graduated from high school in June 1953 , Presley had already singled out music as his future .

The dangerous nature of his stunts makes it difficult for Chan to get insurance , especially in the United States , where his stunt work is contractually limited . Chan holds the Guinness World Record for " Most Stunts by a Living Actor " , which emphasizes " no insurance company will underwrite Chan 's productions in which he performs all his own stunts " . In addition , he holds an unrecognised record for the most number of takes for a single shot in a film , having shot over 2900 retakes for a complex scene involving a Jianzi game in Dragon Lord . Chan has been injured numerous times attempting stunts ; many of them have been shown as outtakes or as bloopers during the closing credits of his films . He came closest to death filming Armour of God , when he fell from a tree and fractured his skull . Over the years , Chan has dislocated his pelvis and broken his fingers , toes , nose , both cheekbones , hips , sternum , neck , ankle , and ribs on numerous occasions . Promotional materials for Rumble in the Bronx emphasised that Chan performed all of the stunts , and one version of the movie poster even diagrammed his many injuries . Jackie Chan created his screen persona as a response to Bruce Lee , and the numerous imitators who appeared before and after Lee 's death . In contrast to Lee 's characters , who were typically stern , morally upright heroes , Chan plays well - well - meaning , slightly foolish regular guys ( often at the mercy of their friends , girlfriends or families ) who always triumph in the end despite the odds . Additionally , Chan has stated that he deliberately styles his movement to be the opposite of Lee ' s : where Lee held his arms wide , Chan holds his tight to the body ; where Lee was loose and flowing , Chan is tight and choppy . Despite the success of the Rush Hour series , Chan has stated that he is not a fan of it since he neither appreciates the action scenes in the movie , nor understands American humour .

In 1976 , Jackie Chan received a telegram from Willie Chan , a film producer in the Hong Kong film industry who had been impressed with Jackie 's stuntwork . Willie Chan offered him an acting role in a film directed by Lo Wei . Lo had seen Chan 's performance in the John Woo film Hand of Death ( 1976 ) and planned to model him after Bruce Lee with the film New Fist of Fury . His stage name was changed to Sing Lung ( Chinese : 成龍 , also transcribed as Cheng Long , literally " become the dragon " ) to emphasise his similarity to Bruce Lee , whose stage name was Lei Siu-lung ( Chinese : 李小龍 , meaning " Little Dragon " ) . The film was unsuccessful because Chan was not accustomed to Lee 's martial arts style . Despite the film 's failure , Lo Wei continued producing films with similar themes , resulting in little improvement at the box office . Chan 's first major breakthrough was the 1978 film Snake in the Eagle 's Shadow , shot while he was loaned to Seasonal Film Corporation under a two - picture deal . Under director Yuen Woo - ping , Chan was allowed complete freedom over his stunt work . The film established the comedic kung fu genre , and proved to be a breath of fresh air for the Hong Kong audience . Chan then starred in Drunken Master , which finally propelled him to mainstream success . Upon Chan 's return to Lo Wei 's studio , Lo tried to replicate the comedic approach of Drunken Master , producing Half a Loaf of Kung Fu and Spiritual Kung Fu . He also gave Chan the opportunity to co - direct The Fearless Hyena with Kenneth Tsang . When Willie Chan left the company , he advised Jackie to decide for himself whether or not to stay with Lo Wei . During the shooting of Fearless Hyena Part II , Chan broke his contract and joined Golden Harvest , prompting Lo to blackmail Chan with triads , blaming Willie for his star 's departure . The dispute was resolved with the help of fellow actor and director Jimmy Wang Yu , allowing Chan to stay with Golden Harvest .

During this period , Warner took an active role in recruiting talent . To furnish Warner Bros . with much needed " star power " , he raided contract players from rival studios , in some cases offering to double their salaries . This strategy yielded three leading stars from Paramount Studios – William Powell , Kay Francis , and Ruth Chatterton . In 1929 , Warner persuaded British stage and screen actor George Arliss to play the title role in a remake of the 1921 United Artists film Disraeli , a project that turned out to be a box - office hit . Then , in 1930 , he spotted future stars James Cagney , Joan Blondell , and Frank McHugh in the cast of a New York play called Penny Arcade . Although Cagney turned out to be Warner 's greatest prize , he was also the studio executive 's biggest professional challenge . During his frequent arguments with Warner , Cagney often resorted to screaming the Yiddish obscenities he learned during his upbringing in the Hell 's Kitchen district of New York City . According to a 1937 Fortune magazine article , Warner 's most intense contract disputes involved Cagney , " who got sick of being typed as a girl - hitting mick and of making five pictures a year instead of four . " The studio 's executive producer , Darryl F . Zanuck , resigned during a contract dispute with Harry Warner in 1933 . According to a 1933 letter that Jack wrote to Will H . Hays , then president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America , Zanuck requested a higher salary and " indicated his desire to raise the salaries of the actors and personnel in the motion pictures we were producing " . That year , Zanuck established 20th Century Pictures , which merged with Fox Film Corporation in 1935 . Longtime producer for the studio , Hal B . Wallis , took over as the studio 's executive producer . Warner , however , denied Wallis the sweeping powers enjoyed by Zanuck , and the result was a decentralization of creative and administrative control that often created confusion at the studio . Under the new system , each picture was assigned a supervisor who was usually plucked from the ranks of the studio 's screenwriters . Although Warner Bros . maintained a high rate of production throughout the 1930s , some pictures showed an uneven quality that reflected " not only the difficulty of shifting to a supervisory system but also the consequences of dispersing authority into the creative ranks " .

In 2005 , she appeared as flight attendant Claire Colburn alongside Orlando Bloom , in Elizabethtown , a movie written and directed by Cameron Crowe . The film premiered at the 2005 Toronto Film Festival . Dunst revealed that working with Crowe was enjoyable , but more demanding than she had expected . The movie garnered mixed reviews , with the Chicago Tribune rating it one out of four stars and describing Dunst 's portrayal of a flight attendant as " cloying . " It was a box office disappointment . Dunst 's next film role was the title character in the 2006 biographical film Marie Antoinette . Adapted from Antonia Fraser 's book Marie Antoinette : The Journey , the film was Dunst 's second with director Sofia Coppola . The movie was screened at a special presentation at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival , and was reviewed favourably . International revenues were $ 45 million out of $ 60 million overall . In 2007 she again played Mary Jane Watson , in Spider - Man 3 . In contrast to the previous two films ' positive reviews , Spider - Man 3 was met with a mixed reception by critics . Nonetheless , with a total worldwide gross of $ 891 million , it stands as the most commercially successful film in the series and Dunst 's highest grossing film to the end of 2008 . Having initially signed on for three Spider - Man films , she revealed that she would do a fourth , but only if Raimi and Maguire also returned . In January 2010 it was announced that the Spider - Man franchise would be restarted , therefore dropping Dunst , Maguire , and Raimi from the film series . In 2008 , Dunst starred alongside Simon Pegg in How to Lose Friends and Alienate People , an adaptation of the memoir of the same name by former Vanity Fair contributing editor Toby Young . After she signed on to the film , she revealed that she had joined the project because Pegg was scheduled to appear in it .

The next year , CTV , Canada 's first private TV network and a fledgling competitor of his father 's network , hired the 24 - year - old Jennings as co - anchor of its late - night national newscast . While reporting for CTV , he was the first Canadian journalist to arrive in Dallas after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy . In 1964 , CTV sent Jennings to cover the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City , New Jersey . There , he ran into Elmer Lower , then president of ABC News , who offered him a job as a correspondent for the American network , an opportunity Jennings initially rejected . " The job was pretty intimidating for a guy like me in a tiny city in Canada , " Jennings later recalled . " I thought , What if I screw up ? What if I fail ? " Three months later though , he changed his mind and packed his bags for America . Jennings started reporting for ABC at its New York news bureau . At the time , ABC lagged behind the more established news divisions of NBC and CBS , and the network was trying to attract younger viewers . On February 1 , 1965 , ABC plucked the fresh - faced Canadian from the field and placed him at the anchor desk of Peter Jennings With the News , then a 15 - minute nightly newscast . He replaced Ron Cochran , a fellow Canadian . At 26 , Jennings was , and remains , the youngest - ever U.S. network news anchor . " ABC was in bad shape at the time , " Jennings said . " They were willing to try anything , and , to demonstrate the point , they tried me . " An inexperienced Jennings had a hard time keeping up with his rivals at the other networks , and he – and the upstart ABC News - could not compete with the venerable newscasts of Walter Cronkite at CBS and Chet Huntley and David Brinkley at NBC . Some in the American audience disliked Jennings ' Canadian accent . He pronounced lieutenant as " leftenant " , mangled the pronunciation of " Appomattox , " and misidentified the " Marines ' Hymn " as " Anchors Aweigh " at Lyndon Johnson 's presidential inauguration ; his lack of in - depth knowledge of American affairs and culture led critics to deride Jennings as a " glamorcaster " . " It was a little ridiculous when you think about it , " he later reflected . " A 26 - year - old trying to compete with Cronkite , Huntley and Brinkley . I was simply unqualified . " After three rocky years at the anchor desk , Jennings quit to become a foreign correspondent .

Johnson and Larry Bird were first linked as rivals after Johnson 's Michigan State squad defeated Bird 's Indiana State team in the 1979 NCAA finals . The rivalry continued in the NBA , and reached its climax when Boston and Los Angeles met in three out of four NBA Finals from 1984 to 1987 . Johnson asserted that for him , the 82 - game regular season was composed of 80 normal games , and two Lakers - Celtics games . Similarly , Bird admitted that Johnson 's daily box score was the first thing he checked in the morning . Several journalists hypothesized that the Johnson - Bird rivalry was so appealing because it represented many other contrasts , such as the clash between the Lakers and Celtics , between Hollywood flashiness ( " Showtime " ) and Boston / Indiana blue collar grit ( " Celtic Pride " ) , and between blacks and whites . The rivalry was also significant because it drew national attention to the faltering NBA . Prior to Johnson and Bird 's arrival , the NBA had gone through a decade of declining interest and low TV ratings . With the two future Hall of Famers , the league won a whole generation of new fans , drawing both traditionalist adherents of Bird 's dirt court Indiana game and those appreciative of Johnson 's public park flair . Sports journalist Larry Schwartz of ESPN asserted that Johnson and Bird saved the NBA from bankruptcy . Despite their on - court rivalry , Johnson and Bird became close friends during the filming of a 1984 Converse shoe advertisement that depicted them as enemies . Johnson appeared at Bird 's retirement ceremony in 1992 , and described Bird as a " friend forever " ; during Johnson 's Hall of Fame ceremony , Bird formally inducted his old rival .

David Robert Jones ( born 8 January 1947 ) , known by his stage name David Bowie , is an English musician , actor , record producer and arranger . Bowie has been a major figure in the world of popular music for over four decades , and is renowned as an innovator , particularly for his work in the 1970s . He is known for his distinctive voice as well as the intellectual depth and eclecticism of his work . Bowie first caught the eye and ear of the public in July 1969 , when his song " Space Oddity " reached the top five of the UK Singles Chart . After a three - year period of experimentation he re - emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with the flamboyant , androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust , spearheaded by the hit single " Starman " and the album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars . Bowie 's impact at that time , as described by biographer David Buckley , " challenged the core belief of the rock music of its day " and " created perhaps the biggest cult in popular culture . " The relatively short - lived Ziggy persona proved merely one facet of a career marked by continual reinvention , musical innovation and striking visual presentation . In 1975 , Bowie achieved his first major American crossover success with the number - one single " Fame " and the hit album Young Americans , which the singer characterised as " plastic soul " . The sound constituted a radical shift in style that initially alienated many of his UK devotees . He then confounded the expectations of both his record label and his American audiences by recording the minimalist album Low ( 1977 ) — the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno over the next two years . This so - called " Berlin Trilogy " albums all reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise . After uneven commercial success in the late 1970s , Bowie had UK number ones with the 1980 single " Ashes to Ashes " , its parent album Scary Monsters ( and Super Creeps ) , and " Under Pressure " , a 1981 collaboration with Queen . He then reached a new commercial peak in 1983 with Let 's Dance , which yielded several hit singles . Throughout the 1990s and 2000s , Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles , including blue - eyed soul , industrial , adult contemporary , and jungle . He has not toured since the 2003 – 04 Reality Tour and has not performed live since 2006 . Bowie 's latest studio album The Next Day was released in March 2013 .

Showing acting skill early in life , Bana began doing impressions of family members at the age of six or seven , first mimicking his grandfather 's walk , voice and mannerisms . In school , he mimicked his teachers as a means to get out of trouble . As a teen , he watched the Mel Gibson film Mad Max ( 1979 ) , and decided he wanted to become an actor . However , he did not seriously consider a career in the performing arts until 1991 when he was persuaded to try stand - up comedy while working as a barman at Melbourne 's Castle Hotel . His stand - up gigs in inner - city pubs did not provide him with enough income to support himself , so he continued his work as a barman and waiting tables . In 1993 , Bana made his television debut on Steve Vizard 's late night talk show , Tonight Live . His performance gained the attention of producers from the sketch comedy series , Full Frontal , who invited him to join the show as a writer and performer . During his four years on the show , Bana wrote much of his own material , and based some of his characters on members of his family . His impressions of Columbo , Arnold Schwarzenegger , Sylvester Stallone , and Tom Cruise made Bana popular with the show 's audience . This success led him to record the comedy album Out of Bounds in 1994 and to host his own television special , titled Eric , in 1996 . The show , a collection of sketches featuring everyday characters , prompted him to launch a sketch comedy series The Eric Bana Show . The series , written and performed by Bana , featured skits , stand - up and celebrity guests , but failed to attract a substantial audience and was cancelled after only eight episodes due to low ratings . Even so , in 1997 , he received a Logie Award for " Most Popular Comedy Personality " for his work on the show .

Beatles ' biographer Bill Harry writes that Lennon began drawing and writing creatively at an early age with the encouragement of his uncle . He collected his stories , poetry , cartoons and caricatures in a Quarry Bank High School exercise book that he called the Daily Howl . The drawings were often of crippled people , and the writings satirical , and throughout the book was an abundance of wordplay . According to classmate Bill Turner , Lennon created the Daily Howl to amuse his best friend and later Quarrymen band mate , Pete Shotton , to whom he would show his work before he let anyone else see it . Turner said that Lennon " had an obsession for Wigan Pier . It kept cropping up " , and in Lennon 's story A Carrot in a Potato Mine , " the mine was at the end of Wigan Pier . " Turner described how one of Lennon 's cartoons depicted a bus stop sign annotated with the question , " Why ? " . Above was a flying pancake , and below , " a blind man wearing glasses leading along a blind dog — also wearing glasses " . Lennon 's love of wordplay and nonsense with a twist found a wider audience when he was 24 . Harry writes that In His Own Write ( 1964 ) was published after " Some journalist who was hanging around The Beatles came to me and I ended up showing him the stuff . They said , ' Write a book ' and that 's how the first one came about " . Like the Daily Howl it contained a mix of formats including short stories , poetry , plays and drawings . One story , " Good Dog Nigel " , tells the tale of " a happy dog , urinating on a lamp post , barking , wagging his tail — until he suddenly hears a message that he will be killed at three o ' clock " . The Times Literary Supplement considered the poems and stories " remarkable ... also very funny ... the nonsense runs on , words and images prompting one another in a chain of pure fantasy " . Book Week reported , " This is nonsense writing , but one has only to review the literature of nonsense to see how well Lennon has brought it off . While some of his homonyms are gratuitous word play , many others have not only double meaning but a double edge . " Lennon was not only surprised by the positive reception , but that the book was reviewed at all , and suggested that readers " took the book more seriously than I did myself . It just began as a laugh for me " .

Tracy and Hepburn appeared on screen together for a third consecutive year in the 1949 film Adam 's Rib . Like Woman of the Year , it was a " battle of the sexes " comedy , and was written specifically for the duo by their friends Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon . A story of married lawyers who oppose each other in court , Hepburn described it as " perfect for [ Tracy ] and me " . She was instrumental in getting Judy Holliday cast in the film , which kick - started the young actress 's Hollywood career . Although Hepburn 's political views still prompted scattered picketing at theatres around the country , Adam 's Rib was a hit , favorably reviewed and the most profitable Tracy – Hepburn picture to date . The New York Times critic Bosley Crowther was full of praise for the film and hailed the duo 's " perfect compatibility " . The 1950s saw Hepburn take on a series of professional challenges , and stretch herself further than at any other point in her life at an age when most actresses began to retreat . Berg describes the decade as " the heart of her vast legacy " and " the period in which she truly came into her own . " In January 1950 , Hepburn made her first venture into Shakespeare , playing Rosalind in As You Like It . She hoped to prove she could play already established material , and said , " It 's better to try something difficult and flop than to play it safe all the time . " It opened at the Cort Theatre in New York to a capacity audience , and was virtually sold out for 148 shows . The production then went on tour . Reviews for Hepburn varied , but she was noted as the only leading lady in Hollywood who was performing high - caliber material on the stage .

They first lived in the St . Regis Hotel on 5th Avenue , East 55th Street , then moved to a street - level flat at 105 Bank Street , Greenwich Village , on 16 October 1971 . After a robbery , they relocated to the more secure Dakota at 1 West 72nd Street , in May 1973 . ABKCO Industries , formed in 1968 by Allen Klein as an umbrella company to ABKCO Records , recruited May Pang as a receptionist in 1969 . Through involvement in a project with ABKCO , Lennon and Ono met her the following year . She became their personal assistant . After she had been working with the couple for three years , Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged from one another . She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon , telling her , " He likes you a lot . " Pang , 22 , astounded by Ono 's proposition , eventually agreed to become Lennon 's companion . The pair soon moved to California , beginning an 18 - month period he later called his " lost weekend " . In Los Angeles , Pang encouraged Lennon to develop regular contact with Julian , whom he had not seen for two years . He also rekindled friendships with Starr , McCartney , Beatles ' roadie Mal Evans , and Harry Nilsson . Whilst drinking with Nilsson , after misunderstanding something Pang said , Lennon attempted to strangle her , relenting only when physically restrained by Nilsson . On moving to New York , they prepared a spare room in their newly rented apartment for Julian to visit . Lennon , hitherto inhibited by Ono in this regard , began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends . By December he and Pang were considering a house purchase , and he was refusing to accept Ono 's telephone calls . In January 1975 , he agreed to meet Ono — who said she had found a cure for smoking . But after the meeting he failed to return home or call Pang . When Pang telephoned the next day , Ono told her Lennon was unavailable , being exhausted after a hypnotherapy session . Two days later , Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment , stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed . He told her his separation from Ono was now over , though Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress .

The thing about rock ' n ' roll is that for me anyway it was n't enough ... There were great catch - phrases and driving pulse rhythms ... but the songs were n't serious or did n't reflect life in a realistic way . I knew that when I got into folk music , it was more of a serious type of thing . The songs are filled with more despair , more sadness , more triumph , more faith in the supernatural , much deeper feelings . He soon began to perform at the Ten O ' Clock Scholar , a coffeehouse a few blocks from campus , and became actively involved in the local Dinkytown folk music circuit . During his Dinkytown days , Zimmerman began introducing himself as " Bob Dylan " . In his autobiography , Dylan acknowledged that he had been influenced by the poetry of Dylan Thomas . [ a 1 ] Explaining his change of name in a 2004 interview , Dylan remarked : " You 're born , you know , the wrong names , wrong parents . I mean , that happens . You call yourself what you want to call yourself . This is the land of the free . " Dylan dropped out of college at the end of his first year ( May 1960 ) . In January 1961 , he traveled to New York City , hoping to perform there and visit his musical idol Woody Guthrie , who was seriously ill with Huntington 's Disease in Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital . Guthrie had been a revelation to Dylan and was the biggest influence on his early performances . Describing Guthrie 's impact on him , Dylan later wrote : " The songs themselves had the infinite sweep of humanity in them ... [ He ] was the true voice of the American spirit . I said to myself I was going to be Guthrie 's greatest disciple . " As well as visiting Guthrie in the hospital , Dylan befriended Guthrie 's acolyte Ramblin ' Jack Elliott . Much of Guthrie 's repertoire was actually channeled through Elliott , and Dylan paid tribute to Elliott in Chronicles ( 2004 ) .

From December 1962 to January 1963 , Dylan made his first trip to the United Kingdom . He had been invited by TV director Philip Saville to appear in a drama , The Madhouse on Castle Street , which Saville was directing for BBC Television . At the end of the play , Dylan performed " Blowin ' in the Wind " , one of the first major public performances of the song . The film recording of The Madhouse on Castle Street was destroyed by the BBC in 1968 . While in London , Dylan performed at several London folk clubs , including The Troubadour , Les Cousins , and Bunjies . He also learned new material from several UK performers , including Martin Carthy . By the time Dylan 's second album , The Freewheelin ' Bob Dylan , was released in May 1963 , he had begun to make his name as both a singer and a songwriter . Many of the songs on this album were labeled protest songs , inspired partly by Guthrie and influenced by Pete Seeger 's passion for topical songs . " Oxford Town " , for example , was a sardonic account of James Meredith 's ordeal as the first black student to risk enrollment at the University of Mississippi . His most famous song at this time , " Blowin ' in the Wind " , partially derived its melody from the traditional slave song " No More Auction Block " , while its lyrics questioned the social and political status quo . The song was widely recorded and became an international hit for Peter , Paul and Mary , setting a precedent for many other artists who had hits with Dylan 's songs . " A Hard Rain 's a - Gonna Fall " was based on the tune of the folk ballad " Lord Randall " . With its veiled references to nuclear apocalypse , it gained even more resonance when the Cuban missile crisis developed only a few weeks after Dylan began performing it . Like " Blowin ' in the Wind " , " A Hard Rain 's a - Gonna Fall " marked an important new direction in modern songwriting , blending a stream - of - consciousness , imagist lyrical attack with a traditional folk form .

In the summer of 1952 , Hepburn appeared in London 's West End for a ten - week run of George Bernard Shaw 's The Millionairess . Her parents had read Shaw to her when she was a child , which made the play a special experience for the actress . Two years of intense work had left her exhausted , however , and her friend Constance Collier wrote that Hepburn was " on the verge of a nervous breakdown " . Widely acclaimed , The Millionairess was brought to Broadway . In October 1952 it opened at the Shubert Theatre , where despite a lukewarm critical response it sold out its ten - week run . Hepburn subsequently tried to get the play adapted into a film : a script was written by Preston Sturges , and Hepburn offered to work for nothing and pay the director herself , but no studio picked up the project . She later referred to this as the biggest disappointment of her career . Pat and Mike was the last film Hepburn completed on her MGM contract , making her free to select her own projects . She spent two years resting and traveling , before committing to David Lean 's romantic drama Summertime ( 1955 ) . The movie was filmed in Venice , with Hepburn playing a lonely spinster who has a passionate love affair . She described it as " a very emotional part " and found it fascinating to work with Lean . At her own insistence , Hepburn performed a fall into a canal and developed a chronic eye infection as a result . The role earned her another Academy Award nomination and has been cited as some of her finest work . Lean later said it was his personal favorite of the films he made , and Hepburn his favorite actress . The following year , Hepburn spent six months touring Australia with the Old Vic theatre company , playing Portia in The Merchant of Venice , Kate in The Taming of the Shrew , and Isabella in Measure for Measure . The tour was successful and Hepburn earned significant plaudits for the effort .

According to FBI surveillance reports ( and confirmed by Tariq Ali in 2006 ) Lennon was sympathetic to the International Marxist Group , a Trotskyist group formed in Britain in 1968 . However , the FBI considered Lennon to have limited effectiveness as a revolutionary since he was " constantly under the influence of narcotics " . In 1973 , Lennon contributed a limerick called " Why Make It Sad To Be Gay ? " to Len Richmond 's The Gay Liberation Book . Lennon 's last act of political activism was a statement in support of the striking minority sanitation workers in San Francisco on 5 December 1980 . He and Ono planned to join the workers ' protest on 14 December . Following the impact of " Give Peace a Chance " and " Happy Xmas ( War Is Over ) " , both strongly associated with the anti – Vietnam War movement , the Nixon administration , hearing rumours of Lennon 's involvement in a concert to be held in San Diego at the same time as the Republican National Convention , tried to have him deported . Nixon believed that Lennon 's anti - war activities could cost him his re - election ; Republican Senator Strom Thurmond suggested in a February 1972 memo that " deportation would be a strategic counter - measure " against Lennon . The next month the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service ( INS ) began deportation proceedings , arguing that his 1968 misdemeanor conviction for cannabis possession in London had made him ineligible for admission to the United States . Lennon spent the next three and a half years in and out of deportation hearings until on 8 October 1975 , when a court of appeals barred the deportation attempt , stating " ... the courts will not condone selective deportation based upon secret political grounds . " While the legal battle continued , Lennon attended rallies and made television appearances . Lennon and Ono co - hosted the Mike Douglas Show for a week in February 1972 , introducing guests such as Jerry Rubin and Bobby Seale to mid - America . In 1972 , Bob Dylan wrote a letter to the INS defending Lennon , stating :
